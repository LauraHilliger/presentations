Hello everyone and thank you for having me. My name is Laura Hilliger and today I want to talk about what we call Web Literacy, how we can embed the skills and competencies that term covers into any educational endeavor, and why it's important.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>notes</strong><br/>You see today, today being the day that I started writing this talk for you, my colleague, someone I admire a great deal, called me a sociopath. He was just kidding, but I stopped to think about my perceived lack of empathy and ended up taking an Internet quiz that would tell me whether or not I’m a sociopath (here’s a hint, if you’re worried about being a sociopath, you aren’t a sociopath).<br/>
<br/>
The quiz told me that I’m within the normal range for a typical human being. Then it let me know that I ...</p>

The open ethos is a philosophical idea that working in a decentralized, innovative, remixable and transparent way leads to more innovation. On the World Wide Web, these ideas are grounded in the Open Source Movement, which served as a catalyst for the more general “Open Movement”.

Lots of us in the tech industry work on holidays.

We – the designers, developers, webby nerds who can attach images to emails problem free – are actually the minority. We – the makers and creators of digital things – are more talented than we think, and it’s ti...</p>
