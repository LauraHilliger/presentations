            <Text>My name is Laura Hilliger, I think many of you are already aware of the work we’re doing at Mozilla Webmaker, so I thought I’d give you a quick background and then we can just chat.

I like to Teach the Web. I’ve been walking the line between education and technology my entire career, having found an affinity for playing with computers and code and messing around with various types of software at a pretty early age. I remember falling in love with the Web the first time it took 22 minutes to log on through a modem that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve loved it ever since, through all it’s phases, and I’ve spent a lot of time understanding why I feel the way I feel about it. It’s because the Web is an ecosystem of knowledge – it has the power to connect all of us, to help us find our kindred spirits, to change the world. It can do all of those things, if we have the basic skills we need to explore that ecosystem and exchange ideas, stories, truths with one another. 

I love to teach the web, which is why I love working with Mozilla.

Really, Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are all over the world working to teach the web. And I don’t just mean formally to students, but to each other, to their families, to their friends, in their every day lives. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. And Mozillians teach the web to keep it that way.

Mozilla is a non-profit. Our mission is to help people understand what all of this means, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet.

This month, you are asking yourselves the question “What comes first Digital Literacy or Digital Citizenship?” My opinion is that literacy and citizenship are so intrinsically linked, they have to be conceived that way, taught that way. I think the misconception about “digital literacy” is that it’s all about technical skill acquisition. Individuals must have the ability to shape their own experiences on the Internet – this isn’t just about broadcasting information, but thinking about it, understand implications and relationships, understanding what consequences your online actions have in your online and offline life. 

A few weeks ago, Doug Belshaw spoke with the OOE community about the work we’re doing around the Web Literacy Map. Web Literacy is about the culture, mechanics and citizenship of the Web. It’s not just about coding or making web pages, it’s about helping people gain the competencies and skills that allow them to read AND write the web, to  participate in global discussions, to think critically about what they find there. We need to understand the web, which means understanding how computers work, but also about the social skills that go with living in a digital world. Collaboration, Storytelling, Community, Civic Engagement, Self-Expression, Conviction, Critical Thinking...

At Webmaker, the culture, mechanics and citizenship underpin everything we do as we teach the web through making. We try to meet learners where they are by zeroing in on individual interests and helping folks make the things they want to make. At the same time, we promote open culture, participatory and collaborative learning and individual responsibility. Like you, we believe in connected learning, constructivism and other progressive pedagogies.   

To that end, we’ve been building software to make learning about the web easy. We have three tools, which you should go and play with them sometime when you have a few moments to be creative. Don’t forget to share whatever you make with the hashtag #teachtheweb!

The Xray Goggles are a good first step into the power that we have to be more than users of the web, and instead makers of the web. We can rearrange the basic building blocks and explore the web critically, we can use this tool to rewrite what others have written. 

And when we feel comfortable changing the web that exists, we can learn more to write a new web. Thimble is our browser based editor. We’ve been layering learning content on top of the editor, which lets people see how something is built, and then use remix to create something new.

The third tool is designed to further explore critical thought, commentary and participation in the digital age. It kind of plays off the idea that we don’t just have to consume media, we can create it, hack it, change it and change its meaning. It’s also one of the coolest tools ever, and I’m not at all bias…

Popcorn Maker allows you to pull the Web itself into video. You can use it to tell a story, explore or comment on an issue. There are a lot of great examples of Popcorn Makes that folks have made, and I encourage you to go to Webmaker.org and explore what people are doing. This piece, by the radio rookies, has helped me explain the power of Popcorn Maker for education so many times I’ve lost count. 

This piece was put together by a group of kids in New York. Let’s see…do we have time to watch it? 

At Mozilla, we’re trying to help bridge the gap between technologists and educators by helping both groups have a conversation about teaching and learning the web. We’re trying to get all of these people who care about the web from different perspectives talking together to improve both our pedagogy around the web as well as the web itself.

We’ve been creating some open educational resources that are designed to be remixed. We, the entire community, are co-creating digital and web literacy curriculum together, and exploring the new definition of Literacy and the perceived boundaries of technology. We’re all learning about learning in a world where technology changes every five minutes and what we used to know about teaching and learning may no longer be relevant. 

Part of that learning about learning happens in the real world. We believe in blended learning, and encourage others to get together both online and off to play with the Web, make things, collaborate and share. This is a big part of our culture, getting together and using physical materials like post it notes and tape to explore ideas and make things to further help teach the web, and remember when I say teach the web, I mean teaching about open culture, web mechanics as well as citizenship. We have learning resources for both online and offline workshops or gatherings, and we always encourage sharing your offline experiences with the greater online community. In this way, we never stop learning from one another. 

In 2014, the Teach the Web team aims to create educational resources for the competencies in the Web Literacy Map with; baseline curriculum that can be remixed to fit any subject. We also want to provide training opportunities to help people level up both their technical skills and their ability to design collaborative, participatory learning experiences. It’s a sort of professional development program where we all learn how to teach the web together. 

So, I’ve talked enough, are there questions? Ideas? Desires?

            <Text>Hi! I’m Laura Hilliger, I work for Mozilla, and a big part of what I do is help people, no matter what their actual technical skill level is, teach the web. We MUST teach the web.

I like to Teach the Web. I’ve been walking the line between education and technology my entire career, having found an affinity for playing with computers and code and messing around with various types of software at a pretty early age. I remember falling in love with the Web the first time it took 22 minutes to log on through a modem that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve loved it ever since, through all it’s phases, and I’ve spent a lot of time understanding why I feel the way I feel about it.

It can do all of those things, if we have the basic skills we need to explore that ecosystem and exchange ideas, stories, truths with one another. 

I love to teach the web, which is why I love working with Mozilla. You know Mozilla as the makers of Firefox, but Really, Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are all over the world working to teach the web. And I don’t just mean formally to students, but to each other, to their families, to their friends, in their every day lives. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. And Mozillians teach the web to keep it that way.

You see web literacy isn’t just about technical skills, technical skills can be learned on your own through tinkering and play. Web Literacy is about active citizenship in the digital age. 

What I mean by teach the web is embrace and spread the ethos of open culture. Openness is about transparency, decentralization, and remix ability, it’s also about allowing yourself to have ideas and to play with them, allow others to play with them. These are concepts that you, as an educator,  can start baking into your very practice. 

The mechanics of the web allow for a riff and remix culture, so too should the mechanics of education. I think remix is a natural state of being, and we need to teach people how they should present their work so that others can riff off of ideas and participate or contribute to that work. We have a place that makes it easy, and it’s in the ecosystem that is the web. 

As Gardner said The Web isn’t just a technical platform where we store bits and bytes. It is a manifestation of human knowledge or even the human experience, the good AND the bad. 

And if you believe in the remarkable ability of the human brain to invent and innovate and shape ideas (how could you not?), then the web is a place to share and collaborate on ideas to solve the types of global problems we face now and in the future. So we have to teach the web. We have to show people how to contribute, how to work together, how to MAKE, BUILD, CREATE, PLAY, FAIL and read, write and participate in our knowledge network.</Text>

The open ethos is a philosophical idea that working in a decentralized, innovative, remixable and transparent way leads to more innovation. On the World Wide Web, these ideas are grounded in the Open Source Movement, which served as a catalyst for the more general “Open Movement”. The Open Movement is a collaborative form of work that takes into consideration each contributor's opinion and knowledge to develop solid programs and content that are revised after each evaluation.


"Bei Mozilla, wir wollen dass alle Leute partizipieren in die Gestaltung des Webs können. Und wenn ich Gestaltung sage, ich meine nicht nur an die Technologie ebene, sondern auch an die Wissensebene. Ihr haben alle irgendwas zu sagen, ihre Gehirne sind bereit am globalen Austausch von Informationen mitzumachen. Ihr braucht ausreichende Fähigkeiten, um ihre Meinung in Welt klarzustellen. Wir wollen ihr helfen solche Fähigkeiten zu lernen."

"Wir glauben, dass wenn ihr spaß hat und etwas echtes schafft, lernt ihr mehr. Ihre Intressen fügt zu lernen. Wer hier spiel in eine Band? Warum machst du das? Weiß du dass Instrumente zu spiele macht Man kluger? Es macht die Erinnerung scharfer, es lehrt Disziplin, du fühlst dich Gut dass du das kannst, girls dig musicians...Programmieren, Gestaltung, etwas machen/bauen macht mann kluger auch. Und am Web du kannst alles bauen."

"Ihr könnte Videos bauen, wo die ganzen Welt in die Inhalt des Videos partizipieren können. "

"du kannst Webseite bauen die zeige dein eigene Ideen, Meinungen, Wissens. Ihr könnte eine hässlich und bescheuerte Website für Dieter Bohlen bauen, sodass alle wissen das ihr ihn so sehr Lieben.

"Du kannst Kunstprojekte zum Thema Brot machen oder Spiele die aussehen als ob die aus die 80s sind. Du kannst Batman von ein neuer Perspektiv erzählen, an Politik kommentieren…du kannst ja Informationen über wie Katzen Serienmörder sind verbreiten. Du kannst alles bauen."

"Popcorn erlaubt dynamische Datei im Video eingezogen zu werden. Popcorn macht Video interaktiv. THimble ist eine Web basierte Editor, die hilft beim "gutes" Code schreiben. Die Rotigen Brille kann zeigen wie eine Seite gebaut ist und erlaubt die Möglichkeit es zu verändern.

Wenn ihr partizipieren wollen, werden wir hier eine Web Projekt zusammen machen. Wir werden irgendwas für das Web bauen, irgendwas großartig und schön. Ein Web Native Film oder ein Spiel oder eine Schulzeitung oder sonst was. Wir werden zusammen kreativ sein. Einfachmal kreativ.

            <Text>Title: High Functioning Teams

Type: instructor led workshop

Abstract: If you want to have a high functioning team, you have to understand and interact with a variety of personality types. Managing group and team dynamics is an essential part of every job. In this fun and participatory lab, we’ll explore and get to know 8 common types of team members. We’ll discuss their merits and think about how our own emotional awareness can help us navigate common conflicts and problems. 

Open leaders take the time to encourage, help, and inspire people around them. Helping people  grow (and growing because of them) are ways to ensure constant innovation and collective improvement. 

1 sentence: High functioning teams use flexible leadership models and have emotionally intelligent team members. This lab will pick apart emotional awareness and help participants understand how they influence their surroundings.

Notes:

            <Text>CHRIS:
Hi everyone! Thanks so much for having us, it’s really a pleasure to take part in Connected Educator Month and to have this opportunity to teach the web and invite you all to teach the web along with us. 

We’d like to give a special welcome to the educators joining us from throughout the Educator Innovator Network. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Educator Innovator, it  provides an online “meet up”  for those who are re-imagining learning. Educator Innovator is both a blog and a growing network of educators, partners, and supporters. If we want to educate a generation of young people to be innovators — to create, build, design, and use their talents to improve their world — we need to value the creative capacity in the mentors and teachers who support them. Subscribe to the Educator Innovator blog (blog.nwp.org/educatorinnovator) to learn more.

I also mentioned Connected Educator Month a few seconds ago… The idea behind Connected Educator Month is to provide educators with a range of opportunities to collaborate and learn from one another so that they can thrive in today’s connected world. Educator Innovator, the National Writing Project, and the Mozilla Foundation are all proud to be partners in the Connected Educator initiative of the Office of Educational Technology at the US Department of Education. Check out the Educator Innovator calendar for more Connected Educator month activities. And tweet during this webinar to #ce13 to get your thoughts into the bigger stream.

We’ve been working with the National Writing Project for a little over a year now, and through this network we’ve learned so much and met so many wonderful people. It’s truly a pleasure to be involved in the Educator Innovator series, so thank you!

Chris Lawrence. [Chris gives an intro]

LAURA:
My name is Laura Hilliger and I like to Teach the Web. I’ve been walking the line between education and technology my entire career, having found an affinity for playing with computers and code and messing around with various types of software at a pretty early age. I remember falling in love with the Web the first time it took 22 minutes to log on through a modem that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve loved it ever since, through all it’s phases, and I’ve spent a lot of time understanding why I feel the way I feel about it. It’s because the Web is an ecosystem of knowledge – it has the power to connect all of us, to help us find our kindred spirits, to change the world. It can do all of those things, if we have the basic skills we need to explore that ecosystem and exchange ideas, stories, truths with one another. 

I love to teach the web, which is why I love working with Mozilla. Yes, Mozilla makes Firefox…

Really, Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are all over the world working to teach the web. And I don’t just mean formally to students, but to each other, to their families, to their friends, in their every day lives. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. And Mozillians teach the web to keep it that way.
Mozilla is a non-profit. Our mission is to help people understand what all of this means, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet.

By the way, these slides are located at http://mzl.la/oct15-2013-webinar, and the links are live, so you can return to this presentation and explore the Manifesto or other resources whenever you like.

So…principle number 5 is, for me, where Teach the Web comes in. Individuals must have the ability to shape their own experiences on the Internet. To me, that means that individuals need to have the competencies and skills that allow them to read AND write the web, to  participate in global discussions, to think critically about what they find there. It’s about literacy, isn’t it?

At Webmaker, we teach the web through making. We try to meet learners where they are by zeroing in on individual interests and helping folks make the things they want to make. We believe in Making as Learning and that the best way to learn new skills is by doing something relevant to each learner and doing that something together. Like the National Writing Project, we believe in connected learning, constructivism and other progressive pedagogies.   

At Mozilla, we’re trying to help bridge the gap between technologists and educators by helping both groups have a conversation about teaching and learning the web. We’re trying to get all of these people who care about the web from different perspectives talking together to improve both our pedagogy around the web as well as the web itself.

To help these groups mingle, we’ve been creating some open educational resources that are designed to be remixed. We, the entire community, are co-creating digital and web literacy curriculum together, and exploring the new definition of Literacy and the perceived boundaries of technology. We’re all learning about learning in a world where technology changes every five minutes and what we used to know about teaching and learning may no longer be relevant. 

Part of that learning about learning happens in the real world. We believe in blended learning, and encourage others to get together both online and off to play with the Web, make things, collaborate and share. We have learning resources for both online and offline workshops or gatherings, and we always encourage sharing your offline experiences with the greater online community. In this way, we never stop learning from one another. 

Because it’s so much fun to get together with people who like to learn, we encourage and support people who want to organize events in their local communities. From the kid who invites a couple of friends over to build a website to the people who run hack jams or the organizations that set up a sort of learning buffet for the entire community, the community is finding new and exciting ways to teach the web and share web culture.

CHRIS:
One of our most successful examples of web culture bleeding into the real world (and vice versa) are the Hive Learning Networks. Hives are networks of like-minded organizations in specific cities that collaborate to offer a wide range of learning experiences to their communities. Most often, the organizations are informal learning institutions like museums or community centers, but the diversity in those types of organizations is wide ranging. Hive NYC, for example, includes everything from internationally known museums to neighborhood community centers.

Hive Learning Network organizations share resources to spread learning and literacy to the cities where they exist. It’s through collaboration and open conversation that Hives are able to secure funding to bring a variety of innovative learning experiences to their communities. Mozilla has the honor of stewarding Hive Learning Networks in New York, Chicago, Toronto and Pittsburg, and we’re helping budding networks in Athens, San Francisco, various cities in India, and elsewhere grow a make impact in their local cities.

Webmaker is the overarching initiative for the work we do, that we’ve been talking about for the last several minutes. It’s very difficult to cover the breadth of stuff that we do here at Mozilla Webmaker in such a short amount of time, especially since I want to show you the tools we’ve been making to help people learn and teach the web through making. So I’ll just remind you, you can access these slides at http://mzl.la/oct15-2013-webinar

LAURA:
I’m not sure where this statement came from, but it serves as a really good segway into me saying….Speaking of code…

Today, I wanted to show you a few tools that you can use (freely of course) to help you teach the web while you’re teaching other things – any other things. You see, I believe that the web can be taught alongside of any other subject. I also think it’s important that we start to teach the basic building blocks of the Web, at least so that learners can mess around with the Web and so that they can use their hacking abilities to be expressive on the Web.

We have three tools, and I’m going to quickly show you each one. BUT, you should go and play with them sometime when you have a few moments to be creative. Then share whatever you make!

The first is the XRay Goggles…lego, building blocks, etc
I feel like the Goggles are a good first step into the power that we have to be more than users of the web, and instead makers of the web. We can rearrange the basic building blocks and explore the web critically, we can use this tool to rewrite what others have written. 

And when we feel comfortable changing the web that exists, we can learn more to write a new web.

Here we have a webpage about animals. This page was created by the London Zoo and is a remixable Thimble project designed to teach kids about a few endangered species. If I hit the Remix button, the page and how it was built, loads into Thimble, a browser based editor…On the left….

We know that the Web is not about code. And we know that understanding a little bit of code is not enough, which is why we, as a community, have been working on creating a web and learning standard we’re calling the Web Literacy Standard. The idea is to try and define the competencies and skill that make up literacy today. And to design the standard in a way that is flexible enough that as technology advances, the standard still makes some sort of sense. We need to understand computers, true, but we also need to understand ourselves and each other. These lessons aren’t new ones, but they are ones that take on different meaning because of the advancement of technology. What does it mean to be educated in the 21st Century? 

The third tool is designed to further explore critical thought, commentary and participation in the digital age. It kind of plays off the idea that we don’t just have to consume media, we can create it, hack it, change it and change its meaning. It’s also one of the coolest tools ever, and I’m not at all bias…

Popcorn Maker allows you to pull the Web itself into video. You can use it to tell a story, explore or comment on an issue. There are a lot of great examples of Popcorn Makes that folks have made, and I encourage you to go to Webmaker.org and explore what people are doing. This piece, by the radio rookies, has helped me explain the power of Popcorn Maker for education so many times I’ve lost count. 

This piece was put together by a group of kids in New York. Let’s see…do we have time to watch it? 

Again, I can hit the remix button and see how this was built…

CHRIS:
It’s not just about spreading tools that allow you to look inside the web and what’s on it, we’re part of a movement, a movement that I’m very pleased you all are a part of as well.  Next week, we’ll be in London for the annual Mozilla Festival, Mozilla’s largest public event. For three days, we’ll learn, make, share, break, fail and learn some more, together. We’ll continue this work, pushing the future of education and technology by making and sharing and being champions of open culture. I included a quick promo from last year’s festival…

So in closing, the Digital World is gigantic, and we’re a small, but growing community. We’re passionate, idealistic, friendly and silly. We’re sharing everything we do through the #teachtheweb hashtag and @mozteach or @webmaker twitter accounts. And we invite you all to get involved, join the Webmaker community, and help us teach the web.

Now…do we have time for questions?

Abstract
Mozilla has made a   committment to Learning.  We're aiming to create a generation of   Webmakers. A web maker is anyone who makes things using the open ethos   and building blocks  of the web. This panel will talk about the Web as  a  set of building blocks, like lego and why you should care. When  Mozilla  talks about its new initiatives, it's important to understand  that  Mozilla isn't aiming to create computer scientists or career  developers.  Mozilla just wants everyone to understand that there is a  4th literacy,  Web Literacy, and in this day and age, it's important to  understand  that code can be pulled apart and remixed.

            <Title>Creative Leadership Pathways</Title>
            <Text>The problem: 
The feeling of career advancement for “creative” leaders (as opposed to “people” leaders). 
Demoralizing to never “move up”, 
It’s difficult to assess ourselves and determine new directions for our thinking. 

Feelings we need to address:
Isolation / being out of the loop
Instability
Resentment (Promotions going to people who have less tenure is hard to swallow, people in this track swing the gambit between trusting their manager(s) illicitly and believing that there’s a conversation going on behind their back).
Misunderstanding
Lack of agency (“need” to go through manager)
Lack of empowerment (by spreading the meme that these folks need to go through managers)
Being used for ideas
Solutions
Open honest conversation about professional and personal skill development
Interested MGMT in what is missing for creative leadership, and an honest attempt to provide some of those things
A formalized advisory group - many creative leaders have backchannels with managers, are feeding the ideas and work into the spotlights the managers are standing in. If creative leaders knew who the others were, and met with those people at intervals, what kind of advice could they provide their managers with? Would also serve as a safe space to rant about blockers or ideas, a space without “HR”
A formalized mentorship program, perhaps combined with the above.

            <Text>#teachtheweb: Open Curriculum and Creative Remixing
short
Mozilla Webmaker is tools, curriculum, and a community building a movement to teach the web. Join Mozilla Webmaker to explore remixable curricula and a few easy-to-use creation tools for your classroom. Share your own strategies for bringing the web and all that it is into your students lives.
extended
There are a gazillion open educational resources, but educators are natural remixers, natural hackers and naturally find the value in play and exploration. We create new curricula not always because we have to, but because we know that we can make things more relevant to our particular learners. In this conversation, we’ll explore what’s missing in our curricula creation processes, and we’ll share strategies for innovative media use in the classroom. We’ll play around with Teaching Kits and learning resources educators have been making on Webmaker.org, and we’ll look at the tools they’ve used to make them.  We’ll also talk about why Web Literacy competencies are important to bring into the classroom and look at some baseline curricula that can be used to teach while you yourself are still learning. 
We can use open technologies to help students take control of their own learning, and we can use these technologies to better our own praxis, extend our personal learning networks and find mentorship. There are thousands of online tools and systems that promise to be the perfect environment for learning, but what if the Web itself is the platform? Connected Educators are beginning to explore this idea, and Mozilla Webmaker wants to help you both learn and teach the web.
Conversation type
This conversation will be an active, maker focused workshop. Participants will begin by reflecting on their OER creation processes and surfacing the one (or top three) biggest headaches about contributing to or using open educational resource libraries. Then, we will form creation groups to MAKE OERs through remix and exploration. At the end, we’ll have some new resources and participants will have a better understanding of how the web IS the platform.

Laura Hilliger, Greenpeace

Summit Theme and Goals
The theme of the 2017 Global Summit is "Sharing and the Commons: What's Next?". Please consider how your proposal addresses this theme.

Your session(s) should align with one of 3 Summit goals:
1.To define sharing and the Commons for our generation
- What pressing challenges and/or threats does the Commons currently face?
- What do we mean when we say the Commons?
- What issues need the network’s focus and support in the next two years, particularly given our shift in focus toward meaningful human collaboration?
- How do we strengthen, expand, and celebrate our ties to the creators of the culture that makes the Commons visible and real to people?

Preference will be given to sessions that incorporate voices from diverse backgrounds and/or different global communities. How does your session accomplish this?

Laura and Jess have a longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion. They are champions of community building and open practices. In this session Laura and Jess will share their experiences working openly, being transparent, and using technologies that support collaboration and invite participation. Coming from organizations such as Mozilla, Bocoup and Greenpeace, Laura and Jess have been core contributors and creators of open source projects. They are adept at bringing together local communities to create a global relevance.

What outcome are you hoping to achieve with your session? *
The more concrete, the better. For example, I hope to come up with a prototype for a social platform that encourages open and productive discourse on world events.

Through making and sharing we want to:
	•	Help people understand how to bring an open work mindset to their organizations and projects  
	•	Help connect Creative Commons enthusiasts to activists and establish meaningful human collaboration 
	•	Teach how to do open, distributed design 
	•	Share useful CC licensed resources like the Open Decision Framework and the Open Design Kit 
	•	Find contributors to the Greenpeace / Bocoup collaboration 

Abstract (100 words)

The traditional designer - client relationship is fading away. Bocoup and Greenpeace are redefining this dynamic through the redesign of Greenpeace.org. 

People who don’t identify as designers are being empowered to take on active roles in ideation, design and execution. We will explore how the role of designer has changed and examine the tools we have to support and facilitate this movement.

This session will also look at behaviors that spur cultural shifts. Drawing on experience bringing open practices to Greenpeace International, we will examine the social and cultural norms that make open implementation more or less challenging.

Please provide a longer description with any and all information you would like us to know about your session, the topic, and what it will entail.

From contract negotiation to deployment, we will explore open decision and design frameworks to help you and your organization establish relationships that can achieve global impacts. 

User-driven and community-based design projects impactful and fulfilling. In the redesign of Greenpeace.org the use of the Open Decision Framework, the Open Design Kit and community collaboration is of highest importance. In this interactive session, we’d like to share our experiences in a hands on way. Participants can bring their ideas, their businesses, their strategic directions, and we’ll help them set up structures and processes that invite people in. We’ll give advice, talk through issues and create a working atmosphere that helps people solve real world problems.

How much time do you prefer for your session? *
2 – 3 hours as a workshop

How many people may participate at one time? Please note that we are expecting 400-500 participants at the Summit. *

Up to 50 for a workshop (up to 500 for a talk)

Describe how you will adapt your session to accommodate more or fewer people than your ideal number of participants. *

Laura and Jess are excellent at creating content for live events and can adapt this to be a presentation, an intimate fireside chat, whatever format you prefer. We’re flexible and creative. If we run a large workshop, we can break the group into small workshopping teams. 

What are your audio/visual equipment needs? Please describe.
Do you need any special materials? If so, what is the estimated cost in USD?

A projector or monitor, big sheets of paper, post its and colorful markers would be helpful, but like we said, we’re very adaptable. 

In addition to English, please indicate any other language(s) you are comfortable to present in. We can’t promise that translation will be available, but we will try.
Laura speaks fluent German and could imagine a similar session specifically for German speakers.

Would you be willing to combine your session with another presenter with a similar idea? Of course it depends on the other speaker and their ideas!

Please give permission for your session materials/recordings to be licensed and shared under CC BY. *
Yup. We will even share our workshop activities on Open Design Kit with a cc by license. 

What is your involvement with Creative Commons?
We are advocates for free culture and CC licensing. We contribute to a variety of open source communities and have many friends, peers and colleagues in the CC community. We have worked with and championed Creative Commons through both Mozilla and Greenpeace, as well as in our personal circles. Bocoup advocates for the commons in all of our creative and technological partnerships.

How did you hear about the 2017 Global Summit?
We’re members of the community, we’re in the CC Slack channel and #creativecommons on IRCs :)

Is there anyone else you think we should reach out to as we build our program for the 2017 Global Summit?

We’re sure you have our similar networks mostly covered. However, Beyonce would be awesome.















use of open practices:
— open evangelism
— open design
— open community

Title: How to Capture and Share a Visual Thought.

Preference will be given to sessions that incorporate voices from diverse backgrounds and/or different global communities. How does your session accomplish this?

I've created a visual guide to accompany the session, and I'll partner up groups of people with a common working language. The majority of the session will be participatory and involve creating shareable assets, so this should work well.

What outcome are you hoping to achieve with your session? *
The more concrete, the better. For example, I hope to come up with a prototype for a social platform that encourages open and productive discourse on world events. A number of visual thoughts contributed to the digital commons.

The session will empower and enable participants to recognise that they have a unique perspective on the world, and that thoughts from that perspective are worth capturing and sharing.

Abstract (100 words)

A picture says a thousand words - and it’s never been easier to create and share images that can have real impact.

If you’d asked me a couple of years ago - “Can you draw?” I’d have said “Not really - I’m a programmer”. However, creating visual thoughts is now central to everything I do.

This session will illustrate how a visual thought can be captured, created and shared. Before the session, we'll have gathered up some quotes from earlier keynotes, with participants choosing one that resonates to turn into a visual articulation. I'll share techniques and tricks relating to how I go about visually articulating a thought that resonates with me.

Visual thoughts are limited by the ability to listen and understand, and not by a lack of artistic talent…

Please provide a longer description with any and all information you would like us to know about your session, the topic, and what it will entail. (300 word max)

I’ll unpack the process I go through: Listen - Capture - Visualise - Create - Edit - Share and briefly share the devices and apps that I use to help me.

However, the main thrust of the session is to get people past the "I can't draw for toffee" barrier, and see what happens when they have a go. Encouragement plays a large part, as does a community of people having a go at the same time.

I've ran this session twice before at Mozfest, and it works well with an active audience willing to think for themselves, and have a go at learning something new. It never ceases to amaze me that even though a number of people might focus in on a particular quote, the visual articulations are so different, even though they were in the same environment at the same time to hear the thought being uttered. It's because each of us has a unique perspective when listening to or understanding anything. 

From a commons perspective, this session encourages the self-realisation that each commoner's perspective has a unique value, and that sharing the insights from that perspective enriches the commons.



How much time do you prefer for your session? *

1-1.5 hours

How many people may participate at one time? Please note that we are expecting 400-500 participants at the Summit. *

I've done this session with up to 40 people, using co-facilitators to provide encouragement as people start to create. I'm also open to running this session twice.

Describe how you will adapt your session to accommodate more or fewer people than your ideal number of participants. *

Space is the only restrictor in this session, as participants need space to draw.

What are your audio/visual equipment needs? Please describe.
Do you need any special materials? If so, what is the estimated cost in USD?

The main resource I require is paper (preferably A3) and some decent pens. It would be nice to have a screen, but in previous Mozfest sessions, I've made do without a screen.

In addition to English, please indicate any other language(s) you are comfortable to present in. We can’t promise that translation will be available, but we will try.

Co-facilitator - Laura can repeat what I say in German :)

Would you be willing to combine your session with another presenter with a similar idea? *

Yes

Please give permission for your session materials/recordings to be licensed and shared under CC BY. *

Yes

What is your involvement with Creative Commons?

I've been sharing artwork, chiefly within the edtech sector for a few years now, and use CC licences to enable them to be used and shared by others. A repository of my work can be found at http://www.bryanmmathers.com. I've recently undertaken a number of visualisation projects for Creative Commons, including the "Made with CC" book, in collaboration with Paul Stacey.

How did you hear about the 2017 Global Summit?

Preference will be given to sessions that incorporate voices from diverse backgrounds and/or different global communities. How does your session accomplish this?

Doug and Laura have worked in various contexts and communities over the years. They are skilled at adjusting their language and description to be contextually relevant to people around them. We will seek to help others contribute to the conversation regardless of where they are from or what their professional background is. We believe in both diversity in terms of ethnicity, as well as less championed forms of diversity, such as cognitive diversity.

This session will encourage and empower participants to push the boundaries of working openly. 
	•	Working openly
	•	Open accreditation
	•	Co-op governance
	•	Web Literacy pitch, but similarities between co-ops and open

By the end of this session, we hope to have some sort of an artefact that visualizes or structures the commonalities between the Open Movement and the Co-op movement. This map or framework or comic strip will help people from both movements understand how together open source advocates and co-op advocates could be working together to build a most just and equitable world.


Abstract (100 words)
	•	How can the seven principles of international co-operation feed into the new structure of Creative Commons?
	•	Badges? (might be covered by Bryan's session)
	•	Community participation / co-operation as opposed to employability
	•	Co-op values
	•	Digital skills/literacies and link to co-operation

According to the International Co-operative Alliance:

A co-operative is an  autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their  common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a  jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.

Let's do a little remix:

The Commons are artefacts openly licensed by an autonomous association of persons. They use open licensing to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled system of resources.

The Co-op movement and the Open movement have more than a little in common, yet they are tenuously connected through individuals rather than entire communities. In this session, we try to figure out how to change that.

Please  provide a longer description with any and all information you would  like us to know about your session, the topic, and what it will entail.  (300 word max)

The International Co-operative Alliance also writes that : "Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity.  In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the  ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring  for others."             

The open source community believes in these things as well. In the open community we talk about distributed leadership, accountability, transparency, decentralization, diversity and inclusion. These are different words and nuanced ideas, but the similarities are striking.

What would it mean if we thought about open practices and co-operative ownership and governance in tandem? How could these progressive and successful movements support and catalyse each other?

In this session, we will use hands on activities to spur creative thinking and get people thinking about solutions to strengthen the Commons through relationships to the co-operative movement. Afterwards, we will take these solutions and make them visible within both communities.

How much time do you prefer for your session? *
1 - 2 hours

How many people may participate at one time? Please note that we are expecting 400-500 participants at the Summit. *
	•	Can run with 5, but also with 50 (can corrall Laura, Jess, and Bryan)

            <Title>2014 goals</Title>
            <Text>Top three personal growth goals in your work
Transition, change and fail better by helping others take ownership and letting go when they do.
Get better at communicating our message in ways and to people that results in tangible contribution (be it funding, content development or other). 
Be more systematic and organized in my day to day work.
Top three accomplishments you hope to be bragging about at the end of 2014
a solid baseline content that can be used to run “A series of Train the Trainer events run (almost entirely) by Super Mentors that propels Maker Party to new heights” and proving its effectiveness by running our own Train the Trainer events for our catalyst communities
a solid baseline content for all the WebLitStd competencies created in community at online or offline Content Sprints
help add more partners to our network - partners who make and align interest-based curriculum (using Webmaker.org tools and/or the MakeAPI) and projects that help people #teachtheweb 
Top three goals you have for the mentor team
Package our collective work in a way that tells the whole story
Use/alott resources better so that we work more closely as a team
Create more inner team opportunities so that we work more closely as a team (e.g. Inner Mentor Team Crossteaming)
Top three blockers in 2014 (“blockers” interpreted as “fears”)
Lack of resources resulting in bottlenecking (on development and design mainly)
Overcompensation for our previous lack of laser focus that results in stifled creativity or the absence of exploration, prototyping, trying, failing and ultimately winning
Overcompensation for our previous lack of cross collaboration that results in forcing square pegs into round holes
What are you most excited about in the upcoming year?
Being part of this team and mentoring each other do/be better. Also bringing new people into our community and teaching and learning from them.</Text>

Keynote: Delivering Digital Skills
Hello everyone and thank you for having me. My name is Laura Hilliger and today I want to talk about what we call Web Literacy, how we can embed the skills and competencies that term covers into any educational endeavor, and why it's important.
I only have 15 minutes, which is nowhere near enough time to convince anyone who isn't already convinced that embedding digital skills in our educational programming is a politically, socially and economically responsible thing to do. It’s not even enough time to convince you that “digital skills” does not mean typing and using spreadsheets. So if you aren't convinced, please do get in touch. There are a million reasons why we have to stop pretending that delivering real digital skills to learners isn't important, and I probably  know all of them.
I also don't have enough time to talk about all the different kinds of work that Mozilla and the open source community in general does in this arena. You know Mozilla as the maker of Firefox, and now Firefox OS, but there are still a lot of people who don’t know that Mozilla is an open project. That means that anyone, anywhere can participate in the work we do. 
We’re a diverse community of people, some of whom are librarians and educators, some are developers and designers, some are evangelists, marketers, poets, scientists, journalists and people who hold every other type of interest. The thing we all have in common is that we believe that the web has to remain open, it’s how it was designed to be, and we work together to make sure it stays that way. We’re not waiting around for everyone to catch up with the idea that “digital skills” are about education, in the highest philosophical definition of the word. We are building the Internet that society needs.
Mozilla is a non-profit. There are no share holders. There are no stock fluctuations. Our mission is to help people understand what it actually means to have an open web, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet. Mozilla promotes teaching the web, and we build the underlying technologies that make it possible to keep the learning relevant over a long time. We work to ensure open technical standards, and we strive to help others understand the benefits of being inclusive and working collaboratively.
What I mean when I say that Mozilla promotes teaching the web is that we are a community of people who embrace and spread the ethos of open culture. Openness is about transparency, decentralization, and remixability, it’s also about allowing yourself to have ideas and to play with them, allowing and encouraging others to play with them, allowing yourself and others to fail (because failing is an important aspect of learning) – both online and offline. We believe that people should create knowledge, rather than just consume it, and this is where Web Literacy comes in. 

You see web literacy isn’t just about technical skills, technical skills can be learned on your own through tinkering and play. Web Literacy is about active citizenship in the digital age. 

The Web isn’t just a technical platform where we store bits and bytes. It is a manifestation of human knowledge or even the human experience, the good AND the bad. 

If you believe in the remarkable ability of the human brain to invent and innovate and shape ideas (how could you not?), then the web is a place to share and collaborate on ideas to solve the types of global problems we face now and in the future. So we have to teach the web, we have to increase global web literacy. We have to show people how to contribute, how to work together, how to MAKE, BUILD, CREATE, PLAY, FAIL and read, write and participate in our knowledge network.

What kind of competencies and skills am I talking about? 
I'm talking about the social skills required for digital communication and efficacy in the digital space. I'm talking about the skills people need to work together and make things in an online environment because more and more the things we need to make are abstracted in software. More and more we need people to be able to interact through the filter of digital technology and this type of communication is very different from being face to face with someone. You’ll notice I haven’t said anything about coding. It’s not about programming. It’s about teaching people how to read, write and participate on the web, and the best way to do that is to help them participate in real life, and then layer the digital stuff on top. 

So, given that we're talking about a variety of skill types, from technical to social to cognitive, affective and even motor skills, how do we teach them? What has been working?

We've had a large degree of success with constructivist, making as learning methodologies. We use interest driven, project based learning to help learners connect head and hand and create things that are relevant to them in their individual contexts. We encourage participatory interaction, which underpins communication on the web (because you have to both push and pull in order to be a digital citizen), and we deliver digital skills as a byproduct of the cognitive and social skills that are arguably more important in the digital environment and in life. 

We want people to share digital skills and cool techie stuff, to help people build and make and create and help them connect to the giant community of open learners on the web. We want people to understand open culture, understand the mechanics of the web so that they can be citizens of the world. 

We’ve seen community teaching and learning in action during our Maker Party campaign. This year there were over 2500 Maker Parties in over 450 cities, in 86 countries -- reaching over 125,000 learners. By taking the simple step of inviting people to teach locally, we ended up with something powerful and global.

If we want to build our futures – and share what we know-- then we need to empower a massive community: a community to teach the world the web. The good news? The formula for teaching at a massive scale is actually quite simple. 

1. People who love the web ...
2. Take action ...
3. To teach other people to about the web.

We’re all learning about learning in a world where technology changes every five minutes and what we used to know about teaching and learning may no longer be relevant. 

Part of that learning about learning happens in the real world. We believe in blended learning, and encourage others to get together both online and off to play with the Web, make things, collaborate and share. We urge people to gather in their libraries, community centers and even parks to teach each other the web. This is a big part of our culture, getting together and using both digital and physical materials like post it notes and tape to explore ideas and make things. We are working together to teach open culture, web mechanics, social skills, citizenship. 

We make learning resources for both online and offline workshops or gatherings, and we encourage sharing your offline experiences with the greater online community. In this way, we never stop learning from one another. 

A large part of my job is to train people who want to teach the web to begin thinking about learning in a different way. We’re modeling participatory and collaborative learning experiences by running learning events where roles are shifted and urging everyone to make and learn together. We don’t have to be programmers to deliver digital skills, we don’t have to know everything. Our youth can teach us and each other. I find that putting different skill sets together and encouraging peer to peer interaction is a much more effective way to transfer technical skills. Open, peer to peer, participatory learning methodologies help develop confidence and agency in our learners. They are challenged to think out loud.

The pushback that I sometimes get with this kind of thinking is that people won’t acquire digital skills if we spend our time focusing on the collaborating and thinking parts, if we aim for agency and confidence first. But they’re wrong. Digital skills are no use if you don’t trust yourself to fail. They’re no use if you can’t communicate. They’re no use if you don’t believe you have something to say. And the people in the world who have the most technical skills - the programmers, the technical architects, the digital makers, the multimedia designers - we had to develop confidence to try, because most of us taught ourselves these skills while schools where busy failing us.

Accessing the place inside someone where confidence builds is about creating a safe space.

The fact that libraries have the perfect set up for creating that safe space is only one of the reasons that libraries are the blindingly obvious, right place to be pushing this kind of work. Libraries have all the conceptual and physical attributes necessary, and the similarities between a library and the open web is almost creepy. 

Libraries house knowledge, so does the web. Libraries are community centers, so is the web. Libraries are supposed to be inclusive, so is the open web and the community that keeps it open. Libraries can provide access to the marginalized, they can give people a sense of belonging, they can be the place in the world where a person can learn how to be a person in the world, and the web can be and do those things to. Libraries though, have the added bonus of being a physical space where people can connect in real life. And despite my love for virtual connections, we still need physical ones, and that won't ever change, it's part of being human.

So let’s use our public spaces, #TeachTheWeb and work together to provide people the type of educational opportunities they deserve to have in this day and age.

Thanks so much for listening, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.</Text>

            <Text>	Institute for Open Leadership Application
Authors: Laura Hilliger and Steve Cairns, Greenpeace International
	Cover letter
To Whom it May Concern:
We believe we would benefit a great deal from being selected as participants in the Open Policy Network's Institute for Open Leadership. As fellows and contributors to this network, we think openly reflecting on the challenges and successes of open policy implementation for Greenpeace International's Media Library will be beneficial to other organizations who are struggling to get themselves on the right side of the open culture movement.
Behind the curtain at Steve's over eight years at Greenpeace, he has been a constant voice for implementing open policies within our media asset library. He has worked to find ways to convince our global offices and photographer networks to assign Creative Common Licenses, and has celebrated small wins since the first implementation of a Creative Commons License in 2010. There is still much work to form the “perfect” open source media library. In particular, we see a need to create a variety of policies for our complicated asset library and to placate certain editors and photographers who do not yet understand the value of open licenses. 
Steve's team has been negotiating within Greenpeace national and regional offices as these are the entities that provide Greenpeace with content for Greenpeace Media (http://photo.greenpeace.org). We are aware of the need for strategic community support around creating and applying open policies, and so we are hopeful that you will accept our application to attend the Institute for Open Leadership. 
We hope to utilize the Institute as a time to learn more about open policy and licensing, gain support from your experts in the development of a likely complicated strategy for the Greenpeace Media Library. We are looking forward to contributing our experiences working with hundreds of differently minded content creators.
We are willing and eager to fulfill the responsibilities of this fellowship, but we’ll be honest in saying it’s the fellowship community that we’re most excited about. We know that interacting with the other fellows will provide a number of learning opportunities for us, and we think we have experience and insight to contribute to this conversation. 
In short if you have an open spot for another fellow, we’d love the opportunity.
Sincerely,
Steve Cairns &amp; Laura Hilliger (on behalf of the Library Team at Greenpeace International)

	Skills
Before Greenpeace I had 14 years’ television and media production experience in pivotal line management roles since first joining the regionally funded, Dundee Media Action as Producer in 1994. There I worked with volunteers to produce environmental, training, charity and social action videos, involving local and national organisations across all sections of the community.  After joining the broadcast sector, along with mainstream TV work, my clients still often included major NGO's,  including Greenpeace, UNICEF, The UK Consumers Association, Shelter and Oxfam. I also continued to support community projects both personally and through my employers. I providing consultancy and production services to government bodies as diverse as the US Department of Defense, ( Road Safety Rap) The UK Prime Ministers Office  (Tony Blairs Video Blog) and The Department of Work And Pensions (The Pensions Crisis -  An exercise in deliberative democracy) 
I've led many complex multi-national collaborations, and co-productions, often between diverse stakeholders with differing needs and expectations. My abilities are not only in hands-on project/programme management, or the day-to-day leadership of permanently established business units, but also in sales and business development. I have a wide range of contacts inside and outside Greenpeace and a range of skills and experience, working with budgets from £50 – $500,000 on projects ranging from internet virals and the first "mobisodes" to the infamous Miss World Competition of 2002 which started in Abuja and ended in London. 

	Open Policy Project: Opening the Greenpeace Media Library
	Background
For decades Greenpeace has hired photographers and editors to document our activism and the environmental impacts various companies and initiatives have on our planet.  We've created an extensive library of rights managed, professional images and videos spanning 5 decades and 5 continents.  Our National Regional Offices (NROs) hire local photographers to provide content for campaigns and individual actions, and  those photographers sign a licensing agreement that in effect splits the copyright of a photograph fifty-fifty between Greenpeace and the photographer.
Our current licensing agreement was formulated in 2010. From 2008 to 2010 the Library Team struggled to create policy within that agreement that allowed for Creative Commons Licenses. Now, five years later, we wish to revisit the contracts and agreements with content creators, with stronger more compelling evidence of the need to provide open-source content to drive open campaigning.
In order to achieve a more open, modern and sustainable policy, we believe we need a multi-pronged approach. We need a strategy that takes into account a highly diverse organization with a highly diverse group of stakeholders.
	Description of the Project
We will develop a strategy that includes a scaffolding of open policies that govern the handling of media assets created in collaboration with photographers and NROs. This strategy and its associated assets (such as flexible open policies for individual types of contributions) will serve as exemplars to allies and partners in Greenpeace global networks.
Additionally, we will use our learning from the Institute for Open Leadership to develop workshops and programs that promote and explain such policies. These events will help inspire our network of content creators to embrace open licenses for their own work. As we move towards being a more open source organization, we aim to use the Greenpeace brand to promote the benefits of open licensing.  A 
	Overarching Objectives
Educate, inform and build demand within National Regional Offices for the Creative Commons licensing model to be adopted as the norm rather than the exception with a view to opening the library to the world.
	Potential Process
•	Research Case Studies at other organizations to inform the project
•	Develop policies suitable for the unique Greenpeace situation, while providing insights applicable in a variety of fields or organizations
•	Define specific learning objectives and curriculum for Open License workshops geared towards Greenpeace content creators and editors
•	Achieve a steady increase in openly licensed assets from NROs
	Proposed Collaborators
Image Librarians: Esther ten Bokum, Laura Lambardi, Franca Michienzi, Fiona Porteous
Photo professionals from the Greenpeace network will need to be consulted through the development of this project. We will need their collaboration to open the Greenpeace Library. There are about 40 editors in various National Regional Offices, all of whom have to comply by certain country regulations, they too will need training and support to begin implementing new open policies. We are, however, supported by the International Programme Director, the Global Engagement Director and the Head of Storytelling within Greenpeace International.
	Estimated Budget
Budget prepared for one person to attend the workshop, however if there is a possibility we could have more than one place at the workshop, we would like to talk about it. We have not yet prepared a budget for the initiative writ large. This application may be the first 
•	Airfare: €700 – €1000 (Round trip flight from Europe)
•	Hotel: €700 – €900 (6 nights, arriving on the Sunday, leaving on the Saturday)
•	Ground Transportation: ca. €75 (taxi to and from airport)
•	Visa: €0 (potential attendees hold passports exempt from South African visa requirements)
•	Sustenance: €180 (€30 per Diem)
Total: €1655 – €2155
	Letter of Support
Dear Friends,
It might feel a bit strange to have one of the authors writing the letter of support, but I wasn't sure how to encourage Steve Cairns to apply for the Institute for Open Leadership without helping out with the application. After spending 5.5 years working for Mozilla, I've accepted a position at Greenpeace, and I'm in a whole different world. I've come to a community where the practices and processes we in the Open Community hold dear are quite foreign.
Greenpeace International hired me because of my involvement in Open Culture. The organization is going through change. The organization that Greenpeace wants to be is one that understands and embodies the open ethos. Part of my job is to achieve this, and I believe serving as a bridge between the staff of Greenpeace and the Open Community is going to help me inspire the shift towards open.
Before my official first day at Greenpeace, I attended a staff meeting in which Steve, the Library Manager and co-applicant, expressed a rather infectious degree of enthusiasm for the idea of being more open with Greenpeace Media assets. 
Several days later, when I found the Institute for Open Leadership, my first instinct was to talk to Mr. Cairns and ask what the plans were for opening up this wonderful database of non-violent direct action, natural and environmental photographs. After speaking with him about the challenges he's facing in this initiative, I wanted to contribute what I could to its success. This library rivals Getty in it's multitude.  This contribution to the commons would be incredible to the millions of people and organizations who would use Greenpeace images more freely.
I believe Mr. Cairns would greatly benefit from having the support and enthusiasm of the Open Community supporting him in his efforts to open the Greenpeace Media Library. I know there's no better organization in the world to advise and collaborate with Greenpeace on this than Creative Commons, and it would be fantastic to witness Steve and/or his peers and colleagues learning from all of the other fellows invited to this incredible opportunity.
Thanks for reading, and please feel free to get in touch. I hang out in your IRC channel as "LauraHilliger" or you can email me laura@zythepsary.com
Sincerely,
Laura Hilliger

            <Text>“You’re more talented than you know, so how about you help us #teachtheweb?”
Lots of us in the tech industry work on holidays. We don’t do it for our careers or jobs or bosses, we do it for our families – we clear caches, reinstall browsers, update websites, fix their “broken” computers. We – the designers, developers, webby nerds who can attach images to emails problem free – are actually the minority. We – the makers and creators of digital things – are more talented than we think, and it’s time to put those talents to use by making the world a better place. Join Laura Hilliger from Mozilla to talk about why we need to teach the web, why the idea of “digital native” is BS and how spreading open values is impacting culture and society.
idea would be a presentation of what Mozilla is doing in-between the fields of education and technology and why. I’d definitely include some LOL cats, and funny mashups, but the heart of the conversation is around the fact that formal learning institutions are sending folks into the world without the skills they need to participate in digital society and the idea “digital native” is a complete falsity. It’s about the social impact of the web and the cultural impact that openness has.
==============================================================
There are always people and entities who resist change. Folks who think that if they refuse to learn, innovation will be stopped. Folks who boycott the new. And there are plenty of people who are actively boycotting our 

Educators do not define literacy as just the ability to read and write - both of those things are incredibly useless if you can’t think. Literacy is the ability to read and write and think critically about what you read and write. We are reading and writing on the web, hopefully all of you are thinking critically about what you read and write online. And while the dictionary’s definition of literacy is simply “the ability to read and write”, most people can’t even do that with the Web.

But what about Facebook status updates and Tumblr and Twitter and Wordpress and all these ways that people can read and write on the web without being able to program, Laura? Gee, thanks for asking. The truth is people who are sharing knowledge using those tools are kicking ass, but most people aren’t really 

And Mozillians teach the web to keep it that way.

But I didn’t really understand that connection until I went on this silly quest to earn a Masters in Media and Education. I didn’t care about the credential, I just wanted to understand why I liked teaching so much (and, hey, the credential is worth something right?). What happened was I learned about learning, and knowledge and how our brains develop.

Can you name an Internet meme? Do you know what Etherpad  or IRC is? Have you ever updated a wiki? Do you use Internet Explorer? If you said yes to any of the first three questions and/or no to the last, you’re a minority. Although a fairly large percentage of the world is online, most people only consume the content WE make – and I don’t know about you, but I want to see what other people are up to.
The first thing I want to do is see what you guys know about the Web. If you might indulge me in a little exercise and stand up? I’ll ask a question and if for you, the answer is “yes” just sit down. This won’t take long. 
1. Have you ever updated a wiki?
2. Do you know what IRC is?
3. How about Etherpad?
4. Can you name an Internet meme?
5. Do you use Internet Explorer as your 1st choice browser?</Text>

            <Text>Hi, my name is Laura Hilliger, and I know a lot of stuff about education, media and the web. Today I’m going to tell you some true stories and then ask you to do stuff for me.
So, I’m an American, an expat, but still an American. In the United States, we celebrate a day of gluttony called Thanksgiving. It’s considered a family holiday, and the general practice is to get together with your family, cook obscene amounts of butter and gluten heavy dishes, drink hard liquor as an aperitif, stuff turkey and dressing and gravy and bread and corn pudding and homemade noodles and green bean casserole and mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes and maybe a piece of lettuce down your throat, easing the transition of all this food into the esophagus with too much wine, and then slump in your chair and wait for the tryptophan effect from too much turkey to wear off. After you can move again, you might be subjected to watching American football while trying to eat pumpkin or pecan pie. 
This past November, I happened to attend the family Thanksgiving, and that’s exactly how it was. It was a marvelous and ridiculous celebration of gluttony and family. On that day, sometime after I was drunk, but before I passed out, my brother-in-law said to me
“Can you help me buy a new computer? I don’t know what to get.” To which I responded, “What do you mean, I scoped the Dell you have last year. What happened?”
“Oh, it’s broken, “ he said. “Everything else works fine, but the Internet doesn’t work.” There’s no point in correcting a statement like that, but of course I did anyway. 
“Well the Internet is functioning fine, what’s causing you trouble is your browser. Which one are you using?”
He said Firefox, but I sort of double checked with a “Really? You don’t have to say Firefox just because I work for Mozilla, the whole point of Mozilla is to give users choice.”
“No, really,” he said. “Firefox is broken.” So I offered to take a look. I spent a few minutes emptying his cache and uninstalling some erroneous and irritating toolbars and add ons that get automagically installed when a user doesn’t click the little X at the top of a pop up window. Then I installed an Ad-Blocker and restarted Firefox. 
“That should do it,” I proclaimed. And my brother-in-law said “See if ‘random-university-learning-management-system-where-my-professors-grade-me’ works.” I pulled up the site and he said:
“Holy shit, you’re a genius!” and then my mom said “My computer is broken too. I didn’t want to bother you with it, but if it’s the same problem, maybe you can fix mine too?”
I repeated the process, but this time I had my family standing behind me, watching the “magic” happen. And I explained what I was doing and why. 
———
I love the web. I started loving the web the first time my mom got a connection. I had already become addicted to the computer, really early when I learned how to boot DOS and run this game called Digger. When the web became a thing for regular people, I used to sneak out of bed, put a pillow on top of the modem so she wouldn’t hear it connecting, and stay up until 5am trying on different identities as I talked to people in various chatrooms. I was fascinated by the fact that I could be something that I wasn’t.
I wasn’t always an open source activist. I wasn’t not an open source activist, I just didn’t know anything about open source. I used to think that Open Source was only a way of writing software, and until I got to know Mozilla, I didn’t have any idea of what that really meant. I was building things on the web. I taught myself HTML and CSS and enough Javascript to get by, and I became kind of decent at ActionScripting and building interactive stories and designing and building websites for people. At the beginning of my career I was working freelance and teaching web technologies and software in San Francisco trying, like every other almost college graduate, to figure out what the hell I was going to do with my life. 
Somewhere in there, I cofounded a startup where we tried to supplement Art Education (or rather the lack of it in our education systems) with online video tutorials on creative subjects. Stuff like how to make mosaics or throw ceramic pots or how to build a website using Fireworks and Dreamweaver. I moved out of San Francisco to Germany and kept trying to make the business run. It failed epically BUT as a last ditch effort to save it, I went to the very first Mozilla Festival in Barcelona. 
And that’s where my whole world changed. Mozilla threw this festival, called “Learning, Freedom and the Web” to figure out how people were using web technologies in new ways or how they wanted to. They had this theory that putting educators and technologists together could lead to something bigger. Let me back up a second.
You know Mozilla as the maker of Firefox, and now Firefox OS, but there are still a lot of people who don’t know that Mozilla is an open source project. Hopefully, this crowd knows that. Mozilla is a non-profit. There are no share holders. There are no stock fluctuations. Our mission is to help people understand what it means to have an open web, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet. Mozilla promotes teaching the web, and we build the underlying technologies that make it possible to keep the learning relevant over a long time. 
So Mozilla threw this “Learning, Freedom and the Web” festival, and I applied to show my startup at the Science Fair so that I could understand why no big corporation had offered us millions of dollars for it. What I learned was not that the Startup was a bad idea or that the content sucked or anything that had to do with the startup at all (actually, people really liked it). But what I learned is that Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. 
What I found was a bunch of passionate people who believed that the Web could aid in making the world a better place. They were people who loved the Web I loved. Not a specific website or application, but the entire idea that the Web connects us and allows us to explore key problems together. What I found were a bunch of people that were working together to make the world a better place. I found people who pushed at things in my belief system. Things that had always felt a little wrong, but I could never pinpoint why. I was challenged, engaged - people seemed to care what I thought, even though I didn’t know them. WHY!?

I started contributing to Mozilla. I was so fascinated by the distributed ownership and responsibility, so moved by the idea that connecting could make our world better, so excited that Mozilla was working to make sure the internet stays open, participatory, decentralized and public a 100 years from now, that I just got addicted. 

I’ve spent a lot of time understanding why I feel the way I feel about the web. It’s not about the games I can play or the content I can consume, it was about the connection to knowledge and people. 
I love the web because the Web is an ecosystem of knowledge – no matter where you stand in the debate on the definition of this word, the web is an ecosystem of it. It holds the opinions, beliefs, facts, perceptions, ideas and reasonings of ourselves. The Web has the power to connect all of us, to help us find our kindred spirits, to change the world. It can do all of those things, but only if we have the basic skills we need to explore that ecosystem and exchange ideas, stories, truths with one another. 
———-

We live in a really interesting time. In educational theory, we live in a time of what’s called structural crisis - it’s the age between ages. Theoretically “structural crisis”  is when the world economy is caught smack dab in the middle of some sort of transformational process. We used to be agricultural societies, then we were living in an industrial world, but it’s changing again. Although our time is commonly called the Digital Age or Information Age, we’re not actually there yet because we’re still in this transformation process. People are still reorganizing how they participate in the world because of new technologies - there are people getting online for the first time every day. Companies still have “no remote work” policies despite the fact that remote working has huge benefits. People are thinking in outdated ways, trying to understand what the fuck is going on.

Change is hard, you know. 

I’m sure you’ve heard this term “digital native”? The idea of a “digital native” is one that stems from educational and social researchers trying to understand how media and technology is affecting our brains. The “Digital Native” theory is one stating that people born after 1990 or so are more comfortable with the various interfaces our technologies have so that we can interact with the bits and bytes than the “digital immigrants” - those of us who are, sadly, older than Nirvana. Clap if you know what you were doing the day Kurt Cobain died. 

Just kidding, no but really? Anyone? Oh dear…
Just kidding, oh I hear clapping! Whew, I thought I might be alone in that.

So there is no such thing as a “Digital Native”, in fact most of the so-called digital natives suck at technology. This audience excluded, most people suck at technology. We are the minority here. And there’s plenty of research to back that up, but I was too lazy to parse something more recent so I’ll give you this one:

According to the Pew Internet Research Center’s April 2012 survey (“Who’s Online: Internet User Demographics,”), 91% of Americans aged 18 to 50 used the Internet everyday. However, of that 91%, only about 29% have ever contributed knowledge to the information ecosystem that is the World Wide Web. 

“Contributing knowledge” in this context includes using a social network, uploading photos, single-click ratings, tagging content, commenting on products, blogs or newsgroups, sharing original creations online, discussing key issues online, creating or working on webpages, remixing content, using twitter or creating unique webpages. I will note that the 2012 survey only covered two of these markers, the rest were compiled for the 2012 survey from other surveys Pew Internet Research performed in the last five years. But because the usage of the Internet is changing rapidly, these percentages are likely completely outdated. 

That said, if one looked at the contribution of knowledge markers for 2012 separated from earlier data sets, one would see the percentage of people who have ever contributed knowledge rise to 40%. However, the two markers pulled in February 2012 are defined as “using a social network” and “using twitter”. Because these two markers are so broad, it’s impossible to determine whether the usage of social networks or twitter correlates with what academics would call “knowledge contribution”.

The majority of usage is to consume, rather than build or otherwise participate in a meaningful way. The truth is that every human voice adds value to the conversation, and since the conversation is happening online, we need every human voice participating there. We have to teach the web so people find their voices and at least try to solve the problems affecting their communities. We have to empower people to participate in the global exchange. Otherwise, we will continue to lose our rights, we will continue to be violated by the powers that be, we will continue to live in a world where the 85 richest people have more wealth than half of the world’s population combined.

————————————————————
We have to be more intentional about teaching the web. As Mozillians dream of the future 10 years from now, we’re imagining a world where people are more web literate. Where they can control and shape their online lives. Where they can make better and informed choices about things like privacy. Where people use technology to make the real world a better place.

This is where Webmaker comes it. Webmaker is a call to action for people who love the web to share what they know. We want you--and anyone else you can reach--to help everyday web users to become creators + makers of the web. 

We can’t anticipate what all this learning might look like in 10 years. But we’ve started, bit by bit, by inviting people to teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We want people like you to show non-techies cool techie stuff, help people build and make and create and help them connect to the giant community of open sourcers. We want people to understand open culture, understand the mechanics of the web so that they can be citizens of the world. 

We can’t teach everyone ourselves. But what we can do is use the web platform to connect teachers and learners everywhere. 

[Together.js movie] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC9sXz3tRow

I know it’s experimental -- but you can imagine how Web RTC can become a game changer for learning. And this demo also highlights what’s most important: people learning together. Community -- and not just technology -- is at the core of Webmaker and all of the other ways Mozilla teaches. This is in our DNA.

[Maker Party map]

We’ve seen community teaching and learning in action during last year’s Maker Party campaign. There were 1700 Maker Parties in over 300 cities--reaching 60,000 learners. By taking the simple step of inviting people to teach locally, we ended up with something powerful and global. And I’m here today to invite you to be part of it.

If we want to build our futures – and share what we know-- then we need to empower a massive community: a community to teach the world the web. The good news? The formula for teaching at a massive scale is actually quite simple. 

1. People who love the web ...
2. Take action ...
3. To teach other people to about the web.

This is all we’re doing with Webmaker and Maker Party. Mozillians are all over the world working to teach the web. And I don’t just mean formally to students, but to each other, to their families, to their friends, in their every day lives. 

To that end, we’ve been building software to make learning about the web easy. We have three tools, which you should go and play with them sometime when you have a few moments to be creative. Don’t forget to share whatever you make with the hashtag #teachtheweb!

The Xray Goggles are a good first step into the power that we have to be more than users of the web, and instead makers of the web. We can rearrange the basic building blocks and explore the web critically, we can use this tool to rewrite what others have written. 

And when we feel comfortable changing the web that exists, we can learn more to write a new web. Thimble is our browser based editor. We’ve been layering learning content on top of the editor, which lets people see how something is built, and then use remix to create something new.

The third tool is designed to further explore critical thought, commentary and participation in the digital age. It kind of plays off the idea that we don’t just have to consume media, we can create it, hack it, change it and change its meaning. It’s also one of the coolest tools ever, and I’m not at all bias…

Popcorn Maker allows you to pull the Web itself into video. You can use it to tell a story, explore or comment on an issue. There are a lot of great examples of Popcorn Makes that folks have made, and I encourage you to go to Webmaker.org and explore what people are doing.

————————
We’ve been creating some open educational resources that are designed to be remixed. We, the entire community, are co-creating digital and web literacy curriculum together, and exploring the new definition of Literacy and the perceived boundaries of technology. We’re all learning about learning in a world where technology changes every five minutes and what we used to know about teaching and learning may no longer be relevant. 

Part of that learning about learning happens in the real world. We believe in blended learning, and encourage others to get together both online and off to play with the Web, make things, collaborate and share. This is a big part of our culture, getting together and using physical materials like post it notes and tape to explore ideas and make things to further help teach the web, and remember when I say teach the web, I mean teaching about open culture, web mechanics as well as citizenship. We have learning resources for both online and offline workshops or gatherings, and we always encourage sharing your offline experiences with the greater online community. In this way, we never stop learning from one another. 

A large part of my job is to train people who want to teach the web to begin thinking about learning in a different way. Our formal education systems use what’s called a forward facing pedagogy - an “expert” stands in front of a group of “novices” and tells them stuff. This system is what we understand. At Mozilla, and more broadly in the connected learning and progressive pedagogy landscapes, we believe that the system could be better. So we’re modeling participatory and collaborative learning experiences by running events where roles are shifted and urging everyone to make and learn together.

Mozilla has something for everyone, and contributing to Mozilla is a way to be part of something that is bigger than any one project. We are trying to change the world by living with an open ethos. We are trying to empower people to do good things in their individual, hyperlocal contexts and then broadcast those good things to serve as examples at a global scale. Mozilla is a community of people who are looking to narrow the divide between technology and news, technology and science, technology and education, technology and insert-area-here. We want everyone to be creative makers of digital media, so that they can use those skills to change how our world operates.

I love to use the web to learn, but I’m also pretty web savvy. I have no problem figuring out my own problems because I’m not afraid to ask you all for help. But there’s over 5 billion people out there who don’t understand the web that I understand. 

Every one in this room is more talented than you think. Sharing what you know, making things to help other people do things you can do, being patient with people and explaining the basics - these things will help make the world a better place.

So do that and then tell everyone about it. Thanks for listening and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.

            <Text>Negotiating for Open

From contract negotiation to deployment, we will explore open decision and design frameworks to help you and your organization establish relationships that can achieve global impacts. 

User-driven and community-based design projects are impactful and fulfilling. In the redesign of Greenpeace.org the use of the Open Decision Framework, the Open Design Kit and community collaboration is of highest importance. In this session, Laura would like to share her experiences bringing open practices to Greenpeace and help participants bring more openness into their teams or organizations. Participants can bring their ideas, their businesses, their strategic directions, and Laura will help them set up structures and processes that invite people in. She’ll give advice, talk through issues and create a working atmosphere that helps people solve real world problems.

Title: High Functioning Teams

Type: instructor led workshop

Abstract: If you want to have a high functioning team, you have to understand and interact with a variety of personality types. Managing group and team dynamics is an essential part of every job. In this fun and participatory lab, we’ll explore and get to know 8 common types of team members. We’ll discuss their merits and think about how our own emotional awareness can help us navigate common conflicts and problems. 

Open leaders take the time to encourage, help, and inspire people around them. Helping people  grow (and growing because of them) are ways to ensure constant innovation and collective improvement. 

1 sentence: High functioning teams use flexible leadership models and have emotionally intelligent team members. This lab will pick apart emotional awareness and help participants understand how they influence their surroundings.

            <Text>Vid 1 - intro

HI, and welcome to the Maker Party Partner training video series, my name is Laura Hilliger, and I like to Teach the Web. I’m the Mozilla Training and Curriculum lead, an educator, a geek, and an advocate for openness and learner-centric methodologies. 

Today, I’m going to help you understand how Maker Party works and give you some tips that I hope will help you and your organization get the most out of this global campaign.

First, I’m going to give you a brief background on Mozilla, including the pedagogies behind Webmaker and Maker Party, with a particular focus on this idea of “web literacy” and what it means for Maker Party.

I’ll talk about how we can support each other during Maker Party, and I will show you the 4 software tools we’ve been working on. 

After that, I’ll talk about the open educational resources we have at Webmaker.org, what’s innovative about the model and how you can use them, remix them and build your own. 

Finally, I’ll talk a bit about how to facilitate a Maker Party and give you some tips on sharing your organization’s story and broadcasting your actions to the global community.

Let’s get started!
—End intro vid—
—Mozilla bg vid 2—
The Web is an ecosystem of knowledge – it holds the world’s information and has the power to connect all of us, to help us find our kindred spirits, to change the world. It can do all of those things, if we have the basic skills we need to explore that ecosystem and exchange ideas, stories, truths with one another. 

I love to teach the web, which is why I love working with Mozilla. Yes, Mozilla makes Firefox…

Really, Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are all over the world working to teach the web. And I don’t just mean formally to students, but to each other, to their families, to their friends, in their every day lives. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. And we teach the web to keep it that way.

We are a non-profit. The Mozilla mission is to help people understand what all of this means, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet.

One of those principles is the idea that individuals need to have the ability to shape their own experiences on the Internet. To me, that means that individuals need to have the competencies and skills that allow them to read and write the web, to participate in global discussions, to think critically about what they find there. It’s about being educated in the 21st Century.

At Mozilla, we’re trying to help bridge the gap between technologists and educators by helping both groups have a conversation about teaching and learning the web. We’re trying to get all of these people who care about the web from different perspectives talking together to improve both our pedagogy around the web as well as the web itself. 

That’s part of the reason that we began developing the Web Literacy Map, which underpins the work we do at Webmaker and through campaigns like Maker Party. The Web Literacy Map is a collection of competencies and skills that we believe people need to read, write and participate effectively on the web. They are not just technical skills, they aren’t centered around coding or scripting, the competencies and skills included in the Web Literacy Map are about the culture, mechanics and citizenship of the modern age. Don’t think of the Web as just a platform or a tool, think about the connection it provides us to each other. 

At Webmaker, we teach the web through making. We try to meet learners where they are by zeroing in on individual interests and helping folks make the things they want to make. We believe in Making as Learning and that the best way to learn new skills is by doing something relevant to each learner and doing that something together. Like many of our partners, we believe in connected learning, constructivism and other progressive pedagogies.   

Part of that learning about learning happens in the real world. We believe in blended learning, and encourage others to get together both online and off to play with the Web, make things, collaborate and share. We use Maker Party to  grow connected learning networks around web literacy, digital skills and maker culture.

—What is maker party vid—

So what exactly is a Maker Party? Good question! A Maker Party is an online or offline event that teaches some aspect of Web Literacy and shares the event and outcomes with the world via social media and the Webmaker events platform. 

We encourage the use of progressive pedagogies and practical projects to keep learners interested, and we like to see people having FUN. Learning is supposed to be fun, it was never supposed to be a chore. A Maker Party is fun, it is educational and it creates an environment where anyone, youth or adult, can make something, learn and connect.

Through our brand and reach, we inspire a global audience to take action and come together in a 3 month campaign to help learners become makers and gain valuable online and offline skills. We are dedicated to spreading web literacy and we are happy to be working with you to showcase the amazing learning that goes on during Maker Party. We’re very eager to make it easy for you to participate in this global movement.

Because it’s so much fun to get together with people who like to learn, we encourage and support people who want to organize events in their local communities. From the kid who invites a couple of friends over to build a website to the people who run hack jams or the organizations that set up a sort of learning buffet for the entire community, Maker Parties are finding new and exciting ways to teach the web and share web culture.

One of our most successful examples of web culture bleeding into the real world (and vice versa) are the Hive Learning Networks. Hives are networks of like-minded organizations in specific cities that collaborate to offer a wide range of learning experiences to their communities. Most often, the organizations are informal learning institutions like museums or community centers, but the diversity in those types of organizations is wide ranging. Hive NYC, for example, includes everything from internationally known museums to neighborhood community centers.

In Hive Learning Networks and during Maker Party, our partner organizations work to share resources in an effort to spread learning and literacy. It’s through collaboration and open conversation that we are able to secure funding to bring a variety of innovative learning experiences to local communities. Mozilla has the honor of stewarding Hive Learning Networks in New York, Chicago, Toronto and Pittsburg, and we’re helping budding networks in Athens, San Francisco, various cities in India, and elsewhere grow a make impact in their local cities.

It’s very difficult to cover the breadth of stuff that we do here at Mozilla, or to separate our different initiatives. At the most practical level, Maker Party is about holding up your hand and saying “Yes, Web Literacy and Connected Learning are important to me as well!” and then backing up the statement with some sort of action that shows that – be it an event or the development of open educational resources or tools that support teaching and learning the web. 

—Tools vid—
Now I’ll show you a few tools that you can use (freely of course) to help you teach the web while you’re teaching other things. You see, I believe that the web can be taught alongside of any other subject. I also think it’s important that we start to teach the basic building blocks of the Web, at least so that learners can mess around with the Web and so that they can use their hacking abilities to be expressive.

We have four tools, and I’m going to quickly show you each one. BUT, you should go and play with them sometime when you have a few moments to be creative. Then share whatever you make! You can use the #MakerParty hashtag or #TeachTheWeb on Twitter

The first is the XRay Goggles which reveal the simple structure of the web. The web is like legos, HTML are the basic building blocks, and anyoe can learn to rearrange those blocks into something new.

The Goggles are a good first step into the power that we have to be more than users of the web, and instead makers of the web. We can rearrange the basic building blocks and explore the web critically, we can use this tool to rewrite what others have written. 

And when we feel comfortable changing the web that exists, we can learn more to write a new web.

I’m going to walk you through HTML at a very basic level…

Any more complicated webpage are just built on top of those elements.

For example, here we have a webpage about animals. This page was created by the London Zoo and is a remixable Thimble project designed to teach kids about a few endangered species. If I hit the Remix button, the page and how it was built, loads into Thimble, a browser based editor…On the left….

We know that the Web is not about code. And we know that understanding a little bit of code is not enough, webmaking is about expression, and learning a little bit of code empowers people to be expressive.

The third tool is designed to mess with media on the web. It can help you explore critical thought, commentary and participation in the digital age. It kind of plays off the idea that we don’t just have to consume media, we can create it, hack it, change it and change its meaning. It’s also one of the coolest tools ever, and I’m not at all bias…

Popcorn Maker allows you to pull the Web itself into video. You can use it to tell a story, explore or comment on an issue. There are a lot of great examples of Popcorn Makes that folks have made, and I encourage you to go to Webmaker.org and explore what people are doing. This piece, by the radio rookies, has helped me explain the power of Popcorn Maker for education so many times I’ve lost count. 

This piece was put together by a group of kids in New York. Let’s take a look at how it was built…

You can see that Popcorn Maker is a powerful tool when you’re thinking about web literacies as well as critical literacies, digital literacies, communication literacies and all the other literacies.

Our newest tool is in active development. It’s called Appmaker. This tool is being built to eliminate the need for expert programming knowledge in the design and development of mobile apps. 

Appmaker consists of Bricks, which hold specific kinds of functionality. We can place different kinds of bricks on the canvas, and they can send signals across a broadcast channel to other bricks. 

We’re actively working to improve the usability and functionality of Appmaker, but you can teach mobile ideation and a basic level of app making using this tool and the supporting teaching kits. 

—End tools

Teaching kits and resources

We’ve been creating open educational resources (or OERs for short) that are designed to be remixed. We, the entire community, are co-creating digital and web literacy curriculum together. We champion exploration, play and even failure. We work openly and learn from one another.

The model behind our open educational resources  uses modularity to improve the remixability of lesson plans. Traditionally, educators have made curriculum for their specific group of learners, and that’s still a necessary thing. But with the web, we can separate the specifics from the general and help people make OERs that become plug and play. Let me explain what I mean.

This is a Teaching Kit from Webmaker.org. The Kit page includes the specifics of the lesson. What the overarching learning objectives are, what order the activities will be in, what the essential questions are. But the activities exist in their own pages, with a modified structure designed to give a general walkthrough of how to run a particular activity. Because we are always having to modify our teaching plans based on who we’re teaching, the Teaching Kits use this modularity to separate overviews and supporting resources from activity descriptions and how to guides. All our Teaching Kits are built with open web technologies, so you can always change aspects about them, rearrange and rebrand based on who YOUR learners or community are and what interests them. 

As an example, have a look at this remix (SPECTROGRAMS). One lays out how to use this activity to teach overarching themes about interactive video and the other is being used to teach people how to think about online privacy. I don’t have to create a new activity to introduce privacy in a new Kit, I can use one that someone else has made.

Working together on creating curriculum that functions in this way means that we can solve some of the common problems with open educational resources just by using the web as the platform. These OERs have the version control, authorship, and remixability, built into the resource itself, as each resource can be launched in it’s editing application, right on the web itself.

Everything we’ve been making is open, free and accessible via webmaker.org. If you’re interested in a specific Web Literacy competency, you can use the new Resources section to find Teaching Kits for your Maker Parties.

Finally, we’re building new tools and features to help you find and build the resources you need. The new Resources section allows you to suggest resources and tag things from across the web with the Web Literacy Map, and the Kit Builder makes it easy to build new kits by removing the necessity of editing HTML. Both of these tools are new and in active development, so they’ll be improving each and every week.

—End kits
—Facilitating
Facilitating a learning experience is incredibly rewarding. We encourage you to find a Teaching Kit at webmaker.org and challenge yourself to run a play testing event for other members of your organization. That way you can try out the activities and see what you like about the content, and what you want to change. You’ll gain valuable experience in your teaching, and you’ll learn how to navigate potential problems. In short, practice makes perfect.

Maker Parties are participatory events, so the facilitators job is to engage people around their interests and help them take control of their own learning. 

I like to think of my event planning as designing a learning experience, and I try to set up meta structures so that every type of learner can find a way to communicate, play, create, share and engage with themselves and their peers. Learning is all about shifting perspectives. If you can use your learning objectives to open the door to a learners interests and passion, they will be enthused about continuing their learning in that area.

Practically speaking, the first rule of running an interactive learning experience like a Maker Party is to relax and go with the flow. After days, weeks or months of planning, don’t be surprised when something unexpected happens in the first ten minutes. Learners will be full of surprises, so being adaptable and flexible is important for them to get the most out of your event. 

—connecting
Before, during and after your Maker Party, talk about what you’re doing. Work in the open and share your plans, insights, experiences and makes with the global community. Working in this way will bring more people to your organization by empowering them to find interests within what you’re doing. It will also help you gather useful feedback so that you can be prepared for the day of your event.

Use hashtags, blogposts and the Web to share what you know, ask questions, gather resources and engage with a global community of people who care about teaching and learning in the 21st Century. Maker Party is for anyone that believes in connected learning and empowering people. 

During Maker Party, we’ll learn, make, share, break, fail and learn some more, and we’ll do it all together. We’ll continue this work, pushing the future of education and technology by making and sharing and being champions of open culture.

So in closing, the Digital World is gigantic, and we’re a small, but growing community. We’re passionate, idealistic, friendly and silly. We’re sharing everything we do through the #teachtheweb and #makerparty hashtags and @webmaker twitter accounts. Add your Maker Parties to the Webmaker events platform and find other Maker Parties by searching the event database. We’re so glad you and your organization are involved, and we’re looking forward to seeing your work.  Thank you for helping us teach the web.</Text>

            <Text>Culture Shifts towards Open and the influence of Social Norms

Laura's work has centered in helping people learn open practices, developing leaders and modeling the open attitude. In a traditionally secretive organizations like Greenpeace, helping people transition requires empathy, understanding and patience. Even in fully open organizations like Mozilla, maintaining an open attitude can be tricky.

As we try to open organizations, our focus moves to thinking more strategically about ways to engender cultures of openness. This presentation will draw on the research literature around embedding cultures of openness, as well as the presenters experience in a variety of educational institutions and multi-national organisations such as Mozilla and Greenpeace. Laura will define culture as a shared space and "the prevailing beliefs, values, and customs of a group" (The Culture Group, 2013). She will unpick this, investigating and discussing what people do in that shared space. This will include: (i) identifying that prevailing mindsets and values influences a group's way of being, (ii) explaining how observing the ways people share both physical and digital spaces allows us to determine the practices that make up a culture, and (iii) showing how a cultural shift towards open starts with understanding these practices and gently implementing open techniques to improve efficiency, productivity, creativity and innovation. 

As open practices are "the antithesis of traditional organizational management structures" (Hilliger, 2015), success is achieved instead by a focus on the values and mission statement of the  organisation (Whitehurst, 2015). Laura believes teaching, learning and research to be at the forefront of implementing cultural shifts. Social and cultural perspectives stem from individual backgrounds, so it is crucial to include professional development and technical training around the definition of "open" for open source methodologies to proliferate. In complicated and fast-moving global  networks, strategies must take into account existing infrastructures and subcultures. Organisations can institute teaching and learning initiatives that support the transition towards open by using these structures, engaging individually with subcultures, working with allies and modeling behaviors. 

This session will provide insight into the kinds of participatory programming and facilitation that has led to successful cultural change in various organisations. It will look at a certain set of behaviors that spur cultural shift at individual levels. Laura will talk about different levels of openness, both for individuals and organisations. Laura will examine the social and cultural norms that make open implementation more or less difficult, and explore leadership competencies whose practice leads to gaining merit in a meritocracy. 

In short, Laura will provide insight into the social and cultural norms that make the transition to an open organization difficult. She will explore the emotional and social side of open community building. She will offer strategies and mindsets to help people and organisations flourish by learning to modify their behaviors and practices based on the nuance of culture and subcultures.

Abstract: 
Greenpeace has been using social media since before the Internet existed. In this talk, you’ll hear a story about one of the most iconic brands in the world and how Greenpeace is returning to its roots in a time of social change.

Talk:

Intro: Stories are a central function of the human mind.

Hi, my name is Laura Hilliger, I’m on the interwebz. So when you’re using your social media to tell your networks about #engageprague and all the brilliant stuff I’m about to say, or to make fun of me when I put my foot in my mouth, please do include @epilepticrabbit – you know, feed my ego please.

You know that icebreaker game where you tell two truths and one lie and people have to guess which is the lie? That’s what these bullets are. 

How I dress, how I speak, the images I chose for these slides, the places I fumble in this talk – all of this, in combination with these bullet points, is going to help you form a story about me, personally. Your story about me, as is your story about most things, just one side of perception. What you think might not be true. Keep that in mind.

Thirty four thousand years ago, in a large cave in Southern France, an artist used pigment to create some of the first known paintings. Herds of bison, charging rhinos, leaping gazelle. The animals - some of them now extinct - were rendered in startling detail. However, these were not simply portraits. The animals were interacting with one another. Interaction is story. Every interaction is a story.

Story is how we remember the past, how we imagine the future, how we create our identities. Stories are how we relate to people. The days of the week are stories we tell ourselves to organize time. Sicknesses are stories scientists make up to explain our mortality. Stories are in everything.

Stories don’t have to be fictional or artistic. And they don’t belong to certain kinds of people. Given that a story or narrative is present in almost everything we think, say, or write, theorists often say that after language, it is the most distinctive human trait. Narrative or stories are a central function of the human mind. 

Think about it – how do you relay information to your family and friends? You don’t submit factual reports with fifteen expert sign offs, do you? No, you tell people stories about what happened, what’s going on in your life. 

Greenpeace wants to tell honest stories through social media. Greenpeace is not, nor has it ever been just about the environment nor an animal rights organization. Our mission is to have a green and peaceful world. As a non-profit with a mission to protect the planet in all it’s biodiversity, the stories Greenpeace tells aims to put the ecological movement on an equal playing field with forces that have more resources. 

So we use social media as a tool to access power. 

Greenpeace’s powerful story: a history of how GP has used media in a social way

Greenpeace has always used media to create power. And it’s always done so using social networks. 

Before GP was an organisation, an office or a movement - it was a ship. The super short version of this founding story goes like this: 

In the early 70s, the US government wanted to test a hydrogen bomb (code-named Cannikin) on a small island off the Pacific Northwest coast called Amchitka. Some folks  from Vancouver learned of this test and started protesting – their first argument was quite simply that no one knew what testing a nuclear warhead would do to life on or under or around the island. People worried about causing a title wave. They worried about radiation poisoning. These concerned citizens were inspired by Quaker principles and they formed the “Don’t make a wave committee”. 

Drawing on three quaker principles:
-The golden rule – do unto others
-nonviolence
-Bearing witness and obligation to act

They protested in the streets, they talked about their concerns to others. More people became concerned, but the US Defense department showed no signs of canceling the test. These rabble rousers were’t going to give up. The Don’t Make a Wave Committee  decided to take a ship to Amchitka and protest the US nuclear testing at the site. They threw a benefit concert, raised money and leased a small fishing trawler called the Phyllis Cormack.

MAKE IT A GREENPEACE

The other thing this group of citizen did, though, the thing that the newly formed Greenpeace did that set a chain of events in motion that would lead to the Environmental movement as we understand it today, was storytelling. 

The founders of Greenpeace had an visceral understanding of how to use mass media to tell an inspiring and engaging story. 

The images and the stories of a group of ragtag activists sailing towards a nuclear testing site to protest spread around the world. Bob Hunter, one of the founders, said the image the story was a “mind bomb” – a story designed to shift perspectives.

Here’s another mind bomb (famous pic of GP and Japanese whalers or another??) 

Working with ships has allowed Greenpeace to go to places that most people can never go and to witness environmental crimes/injustice that would otherwise never be seen. 

Because we are there – we are impelled to take action.

Because others bear witness with us – we hope that they also are inspired to act. 

When people think of Greenpeace, often what they think of is daring individuals showing physical courages. An activist standing boldly in the path of a bulldozer in a political or moral act. A climber hanging above raging waters showing solidarity for a specific cause.

They think this because a: it’s true, Greenpeace is full of daring and courageous individuals. And 2: We spread iconic images and stories.

Our negative narrative: Emotional vs Rational

The story of the environmental movement is one that many people now are familiar with. The setting: our world, the characters: huge faceless corporations who care for nothing except money, annoying environmental activists who expect everyone to be a vegan. The idiotic, consumption obsessed public, unaware of either the greed or the planetary destruction. We know the conflicts. 

This story is set up, ingrained in us, even if people have different views on the issue itself.

Over the years, Greenpeace fell into a kind of doom &amp; gloom narrative. When people think of the environmental movement, they think about death, destruction, mayhem.  The end is coming, we’ve been telling our stories as if they’re supposed to be part of the apocalyptic genre. Think about how I described the characters – faceless, annoying, idiotic. We’ve been telling stories as if the characters are all bad.

This narrative is powerful and wide-reaching. We’ve been using it for years. But it’s a shallow triumph because critical voices who deny climate change and push ecological boundaries past their limits are still loud.

Ideological disagreements about climate change have paralyzed global action (both in terms of government and ordinary people).

Progressive activists have in the last few decades, especially with regard to climate change, tried to make arguments with a heavy emphasis on science and rationality. While our opponents have chosen to frame their narratives in doubt, rumors, emotional appeals etc.

Our opponents frame their arguments in terms of loss of freedom, loss of prosperity. For example, although there are much cleaner, more efficient and safer ways to produce energy than burning coal, proponents of coal simply say “Why are you trying to take away blue collar jobs!?” and no one cares that we don’t really need to use coal anymore. They use emotional arguments that hit close to home.

They use fear of inconvenience or fear of losing status to make us buy things and consume things with total disregard for what our consumption does to the planet. 

Meanwhile, environmentalists have tended to frame our ecological problems in rational terms: loss of biodiversity, over proliferation of chemicals. We tell people what to do – stop this, stop that.

People have become so overwhelmed with messages on how they should behave, how they should “be” different, they just don’t care anymore.

Greenpeace has a history of using only rational arguments. Facts, figures, reports. We used to think truth in this way was the answer. And it is. But the truth needs storytelling. We can’t just expect that the most compelling facts will win. 

We learned that our audiences needed to become broader. We needed to learn to speak to “the masses”.

The power dynamic lies with those who shape the conversation. Corporate advertisers are telling the story that we will be prettier, smarter, better if we just keep buying new stuff. But digital marketing is not the same as digital advocacy, and we activists use our social media to ransack corporate bullshit and propose a different vision of our collective future.

Our new story: A Theory of Change and what that means in social media

Growing up, I was a freak. I felt like a freak, people told me I was a freak. I got put in the freak classes – you know, the ones for smart people. This was not cool.  I didn't fit in, people were cruel – you know, sob story. And I resisted.

I have fought social and cultural norms my entire life because I was taught so many conflicting ideas, and my mind works in nuances.

I was taught a story of individualism. That I had to make my own way. That I would have to struggle to survive. That this was normal. That people aren’t to be trusted. That being smart isn’t enough, that I would have to “adapt” to fit in. I was taught that no one was going to help me.

But somewhere along the way, I learned another story – that no matter what, I can choose to be strong, fierce, independent. Through my friends and family, I learned that people would help me. I learned that the world is nuanced.

“Learn to fit in” and “be yourself” is not a dichotomy. We are taught conflicting ideas all the time, and we have free will – we have a choice in what we do.

At Greenpeace, we realized that we needed a new narrative for the environmental movement. One that is as powerful as the modern story of individualism. 

We dream of a future that is a balanced, modern, utopian narrative of social progress and renewal. 

What we want is to provoke hope -- especially for the story of climate change, which has seemed doomed because of its emphasis on the apocalyptic genre.

We need to tell a story of a visionary species. A romantic journey of change and human agency and power. The story of a girl who went from being a freak to being a total badass – where the girl is “all humans” and the journey is from a system and a planet built on competition and to a system and a planet built on cooperation.

We want to change the perspective that Greenpeace is purely “environmental” and help people recognize the interconnectedness of the environment and other causes. We have a broader story about humanity to tell. 

Greenpeace – as well as the other communities I spend my time around, like the open source community and the co-operative community – have started to have conversations about how solidarity and collective effort can shift the balance to change the pervasive narratives in our world.

Using personal and localized narratives, we are starting to use our broadcasting power to tell the story of people, not just the iconic representations of our organization. We do think that some of the issues we address are serious, and it would be disrespectful to our audiences to pretend like they’re not, but we don’t have to take ourselves too seriously, and we can propagate a hopeful narrative in any case. We aim to get away from the binary logic of the apocalyptic genre.

Our Theory of Change is simple: we believe that in order to change the world, we need to go after the stories that shape our behavior and our sense of what’s possible. 

Outro: The unique and human voice, failing forward, being genuine 

So you want to know about our social media strategy? Well we live in a world of direct communications, peer to peer shares, people bypassing the gatekeepers. We are in real time, the speed of light, the speed of communication, visceral connection, FB live, twitter, the rise of personal media, citizen journalism and a collapse in faith in 'official stories' – These are all opportunities to reinvigorate our communications as story. 

Now, social media gives the microphone to so many more people. It has opened up the way Greenpeace tells stories and even the way we think about ourselves. We aren't the lone heroes anymore. We recognize the power behind sharing and amplifying others' stories. Speaking up collectively on more issues. Making space for supporters to speak, not just talking for them.

We are in a place where we can live out loud and start to overcome the socially ingrained, culturally inflicted fear of failure and celebrate the messiness of human existence. 

We have to fail forward, learn from our mistakes and each other and recognized that as a values based organization, we have to communicate to that place where values are formed. The human heart.

In a time when dichotomies abound between the right and left. In a time of political upheaval and the us versus them mentality is part of our social fabric, idealists like me, inside of Greenpeace and out there in the world of technology and activism and art – out there in every industry actually – idealists are looking at the world and saying, you know what?

We are not in competition with each other. Let’s use the tech we have to cooperate, connect, to learn, to grow and to change the world for the better.

Thank you.

You might be thinking, “Wait...uh...actions are confrontational!” and you’re right, many actions are confronting the beast - this is necessary, there is nothing wrong with it so long as the narrative pivots to vision. Other events however, are photo ops and direct communications they can be staged very differently from the classic angry hippy confrontations to more engagement, more humour and more solutions

Global North/white/elite/male dominance → diverse and truly global storytelling. This isn’t JUST RIGHT. It’s STRATEGIC. If we want to be relevant, we must involve the global south and speak to the people most affected by environmental issues. 

Top-down leadership → grassroots, open, people-led movement. Share stories centered around the people. 



Tackling symptoms → systems change. (1)Changing mindsets and (2)Shifting power dynamics by entering the spaces of culture to make change. 



Myths like: 
We are addicted to fossil fuels.
Plastics are the material of the modern economy. Imagining a world without plastics is impossible. Plastics drive growth. 
Apathy: Climate change is inevitable. It’s too late.

            <Text>How You Run a Meeting Says a Lot About Your Values: Participatory Practices for Open Communities

Hi, my name is Laura Hilliger. Today I’m here, stepping in for my colleague Michelle, who is stepping in for me on the other side of the world. That’s a long story, but I swear it makes some sense. She’s helping a community internalize a lot of the things I’m going to talk about today.

Had Michelle been here, she would have written a very, very different talk…

Wait before we go any further and because I’m going to talk about participatory practices and sharing, I’d like for you all to spend the next 5 minutes participating in a conversation with someone you don’t know. Everyone turn to someone nearby, who you haven’t met yet, and introduce yourselves. Ready? Go.

I wonder what you learned in the last five minutes. Can you summarize your conversation in a single word? Come on, shout it out.

I swear, I was secretly hoping that someone would shout out “oberaffentittengeil”

SLIDE 2

I’ve done that a million times. Randomly talked to the person next to me, randomly inquired about what brought them to where they are or what inspires them. Not because I was asked to, but because I caught someone’s eye or because I thought their shoes were interesting. I know that all of us need connection, and so I make an effort to connect with people around me. I’m an active participant in my own life.

I am constantly learning about participation. I don’t mean that I’m studying participation or collaboration as an academic, I’m not actually collecting data on how or why people start on a pathway towards an open and participatory viewpoint, I’m saying that as a human being, I am learning what it means to participate. In life. In work. In relationships. In connection. In being human.

You see today, today being a day last week when I started writing this talk for you, my colleague, someone I admire a great deal, called me a sociopath. He was just kidding, but it made me have to stop and think about some of my self perceptions and behaviors. Sometimes I think I have a lack of empathy. I’m nearly an exhibitionist in group settings, despite my raging anti-social behavior in personal contexts. I swing a full gambit between extrovert and introvert depending on the day, time, situation and I am diagnosed manic-depressive. I am both arrogant and self defacing, brutally honest and a cunning liar, neurotic, self assured, sporty and geeky. I am, in short, a conundrum to myself.

I ended up taking an Internet quiz that would tell me whether or not I’m a sociopath because being able to throw all my hangups on a single term would be convenient. I do have anti-social attitudes sometimes…Really, it’s ridiculous that I would even take such a quiz, as I’m obviously not a sociopath.

Naturally, the quiz told me so. I’m within the normal range for a typical human being. And as a sidenote, if you happen to be worried about whether or not you’re a sociopath, you aren’t a sociopath. Humans have an unbelievable range of emotion, this wheel doesn't even begin to cover it, though, to be fair, it'd be pretty hard to graphically encapsulate all human emotion. 

SLIDE 3

Emotion is influenced by surroundings and norms, so what keeps us from truly participating 100% of the time is fear and the social and cultural norms we’ve been taught are rules in civil discourse and social behavior. We’ve been taught that that the speaker is notable, that the CEO has vision, that the teacher is the expert, that the police maintain control, that respect means being quiet and letting others have the floor, and if someone is wrong, gently speaking up, but only in certain situations and those situations are discoverable by common sense…Naja. That gets a bit complicated.

But all of that is a collective perception that is, in this day and age, teetering on the precipice of change. 

With the invention of the web and it’s ability to connect us, we’ve started to push back at the public perception of “proper” by being bold and trusting in best intentions and it’s beginning to bleed into the real world in fascinating ways. Much of the open community is adopting views around the way we interact with each other. Individual views that were, at some point, collectively considered to be impossible to scale. Views like “Everyone’s voice matters” or “There are no stupid questions”. Simple, humanistic points of view that are directly related to how we as human beings participate in the world and govern our lives.

Part of the reason that I’m here today is to promote the idea that using participatory practices in your meetings and events will lead to better solutions, more inspirations and more learning, and in theory, everyone here knows that. But when it comes to that question of scale, people have a hard time imagining how they can implement participatory practices when there are thousands of people in the room. For whatever reason, we tend to think that a participatory event is bound to be a chaotic free-for-all where nothing gets done and no one can possibly learn or make anything, but here’s the thing: Learning and making aren’t passive, and participatory does not mean formless.

We can and should put people in charge of their own learning and lives by giving them the agency to take control. We should encourage people to share their perspectives so that we can instigate change, be better people. We can encourage these things on a large scale, and at Mozilla, we have. 

[Mozilla story] then SLIDE

SLIDE 5
A large part of my job is to help people who want to teach the web to begin thinking about learning and interactions in a different way. I sort of think of "participatory" as the difference between a lecture and a conversation. It's the difference between passive and active. At Mozilla, and more broadly in the connected learning and progressive pedagogy landscapes, we believe that centering on people’s interests and facilitating connections to help people produce something is more valuable to their development.

So we’re modeling participatory and collaborative learning experiences by running events where roles are shifted and urging everyone to make and learn together.

SLIDE 6

The Mozilla Festival is one such event, and it’s definitely our largest. We practice what we preach by bringing together different types of minds - educators, technologists, scientists, journalists, artists, filmmakers, activists et cetera and so-forth - and designing a space where they can interact with each other and with ideas. We aim to design a space that honors the participants in the room. It should respect their intellect, their skills and their time. We place making and learning at the center of  our activities, and focus on the desires and goals of the very people we seeks to honor. We ask ourselves every step of the way, is this valuable for people? Is it fun?

And according to the people who come to Mozfest, it is.

SLIDE 7 [Mozfest Video]

Learning how participatory design can empower community was something I started to do at the very first Mozilla Festival five years ago. There, I found a bunch of passionate people who believed that the Web could aid in making the world a better place. They were people who loved the Web I loved. Not a specific website or application, but the entire idea that the Web connects us and allows us to explore key problems together. What I found was a community, my community. I found people who pushed at things in my belief system. Things that had always felt a little wrong, but I could never pinpoint why. I was challenged, engaged - people seemed to care what I thought, even though I didn’t know them.

I started contributing to Mozilla after that first experience. I was so fascinated by the distributed ownership and responsibility, so moved by the idea that connecting could make our world better, so excited that Mozilla was working to make sure the internet stays open, participatory, decentralized and public a 100 years from now, that I just got addicted. I found collaborators.

SLIDE 8

For the last couple of years at the Mozilla Festival, I’ve been what we call a Space Wrangler. Each Space Wrangler has a floor, there are 9 floors, and the job is to make the floor awesome by helping facilitate the things that our community wants to do. We are responsible for making sure that the 1500 people who show up have a good time. That they feel valued, heard, encouraged. Now, of course 9 people can’t personally attend to 1500 participants, but we can serve as mentors to active and engaged community members who feel agency around the methods, processes and ideas within our projects. 

Last year, I wanted to see if we could create a sort of self-serving participatory experience wherein the people who were already engaged had a supporting mechanism to engage others. What I mean is, I wanted to make something that was visually interesting enough that people from all over the festival would come to it, and once there they would find calls to action that no matter what each individuals skill level was, they could engage with.

SLIDE 9

I had this idea for a giant scrum board kind of thing. Basically, there were three columns "to make", "making", "made". The 1st column….

I designed a color-coding system and joined forces with a colleague who was trying to find a way to get more participation into her track. We worked with over a hundred people from all over the world to modify their session proposals to be production centered, detailing projects into hundreds of discrete tasks that anyone could pick up and do. 

One of the things I'm quite good at is breaking down complicated problems into actionable steps. So for each proposal I read, I asked myself, what is this person really wanting to do? How can they do that with other people? And what is the result of them doing that? I read a proposal that wanted, for example, to fight the sad truth of gender biasm by helping people understand how it plays out in the media and in maker culture. The applicant wanted to make a piece of curriculum that taught what gender stereotyping is and how to spot it. So, I worked with her to break down "Curriculum for Gender Stereotyping" into tasks like "define learning objectives" , "find website promoting false portrayals of women" , "list some discussion questions for exploring gender stereotypes" etc. Breaking down a complicated project in this way, allowed us to define tasks that anyone could do, and in the end, the tasks could be added back up into something useful.

We organized extensive sets of community-run makes and activities that were based on making or building something together. 

To be honest, I had never attempted a self-serving participatory action like that at such a scale. I’d used the method with a few people, maxing out at about seven colleagues, all of whom are like me in that they participate fearlessly. I was terrified that the structure would fall flat on it’s face, and that no one would engage. That people would roll their eyes at the tasks we spent so much time detailing.

SLIDE 10

What happened was an amazing experience where people opened their minds to the possibilities of massive collaboration, and we made a ton of stuff. Together, we made things for Emergencies + Conflict Zones, to Empower Diverse Audiences, to promote and support Cultural Archives, for Low-Fi and Offline Environments, for Digital Storytelling + Collaboration, to Put the 'Glitch' in Remix: Mashups, Memes + Art and we got geeky with makes for Developers and the Future. 

We made curriculum, examples, handbooks, best practices, prototypes…well we made a TON of stuff.

The sheer physical act of translating ideas and quandaries into colored cards, basically project briefs and task lists  manifesting as a rainbow, helped people have agency. And once people have agency, they are much more likely to wield it. 

No one read one of these cards and did exactly what the card said, because none of the cards were exacting enough that a robot could have done them. The humans had to use their human to make decisions, but they didn’t have to vocalize an idea necessarily. They didn’t have to be brave if they didn’t want to.

 There are, of course, some folks who are activated enough around their ideas that they riff easily off what other people are doing, but the majority of people need design constraints in order to comfortably participate. Practically speaking, finding ways to broadcast restraints so that people can participate is a delicate balance. You don’t want to dictate, but you don’t want to leave everything to chance either.

This year the Mozilla Festival is from October 24th to the 26th in London. If you want to see a reflection of how Mozilla operates, take part in a truly participatory experience and come join us.

SLIDE 11

Championing open learning and designing events where participation is encouraged and rewarded is only a part of how you can use participatory practices to strengthen your communities. If you implement systemic changes that make open collaboration the norm instead of the fun thing you get to do every once in a while, you reap the rewards of what that collaboration brings. 

I think the Mozilla project is a good example of this. World wide, we have about 1100 paid staff in 20 countries, many of us working remotely. The rest of Mozilla is a community who are invited to participate in everything we do.

SLIDE 12

Designing for participation is at the heart of all the things I work on at Mozilla, it is the reason I publish week notes containing links to every document, image, bug and product. I organize my own work around the idea that other people can participate, and most of my colleagues do as well. We work in the open, because participation is key for Mozilla. Without our volunteer community, we can't compete on a global market.

I’ve learned that you have to help people understand why their participation is necessary and create systems that make participation easy. You have to help people understand what you’re working on, and you have to respect peoples contributions. Most importantly, you have to model the behaviors you want to see in the world.

SLIDE 13

I participate in and run connectivist learning experiences that manifest in both online and offline environments. I define a connectivist learning experience as an experience that has the express purpose of connecting people and strengthening networks. The point of our gigantic Scrum board at Mozfest was not to get people to make stuff for us, it was to get people to collaborate. This is also a big part of the reason Webmaker Training exists.

Webmaker Training seeks to model behaviors around online open collaboration and being generous with our individual skill sharing. We all have something to teach and we all have something to learn.

SLIDE 14

My dream for Webmaker Training is a blended learning program that uses connectivist mechanisms to connect people in an online environment and then brings them together in an offline environment to see theories and strategies in practice and build things together. 

The curricula we use in Webmaker’s training program focuses on community participation and the values of the open web and open culture that Mozilla champions elsewhere. We teach progressive pedagogies, maker centric skills, web literacy skills, social skills, technical skills, and facilitation skills both online and offline – and we use participatory methods throughout.

SLIDE 15

Our training program is grounded in the idea that if we model the behaviors we want to see,  we will influence the behaviors of others. We use conversation, not lecture, we set up design constraints, we don't demand assignments, we encourage, not dictate, we ask people what they want to learn, and then we base our agenda design on that, we are flexible, and in participatory practice, flexibility is probably the most important thing. 

Your behaviors reflect your values. This is true for our personal lives and our professional lives, wherein our behaviors are often clouded by our own perceptions of self, our cultural and social backgrounds, our assumptions of what the world wants from us. 

SLIDE 16

I think we all want to be honest and open. I think we all need accolades and encouragement, and I think that we all feel like we have to prove to others that we are capable. But we convince ourselves that we’ll be damaged if we live up to those values. We are afraid that someone else will receive accolades that were supposed to be ours. We become discouraged and despondent because we allow ourselves to fester with envy and fear. 

We humans are afraid to just be ourselves.

Through our work to #TeachTheWeb we are encouraging our community and any one else who wants to get involved to try out loud. Come up with a new way to start a conversation, or a new way to implement design constraints, or a new way to get people to share ideas, and then try it. Who cares if you fail? Why not learn something new today.

The way you participate in the world says something about your values. The way your organizations run meetings and events say something about how they view your and your peers contributions. If you’re working at an organization that is open or trying to be open, you and your colleagues should feel comfortable expressing your opinion, even when your opinion is quite obviously not widely shared. 

SLIDE 17

Putting everyone on the same level and giving everyone agency and promoting open collaboration is a terrifying prospect, especially in business. It’s a pretty unnatural feeling. And it’s a pretty impossible feeling to feel, all the time, that we are worthy of having voice. 

We are groomed to understand hierarchies, authorities and seniorities. From the moment we, as toddlers, start testing the resolve of our parents, we start to learn that the world doesn’t revolve around our individual selves and we begin to perceive that someone else in any given situation has more power than we do. 

We are told what we’re not capable, and for whatever reason, we believe what we’re told. Sometimes, we assume that someone else has more information, and sometimes they do, but sometimes the greater good is something we can influence, and we choose not to because, again, we’re afraid.

Let’s be very clear that openness, collaboration and respect for ourselves does not mean filterless, controlling and arrogant. It’s about conditioning our emotional intelligence. 

Slide 18

I think designing and using participatory methods is mostly about opening the door for people. Help people see what it means to have agency. At Mozilla, we're successful if we take initiative. It doesn't matter if we fail, it's about believing that we have agency. 

We work in the open, sharing half baked ideas, prototypes, failures, challenges, and everything else we’re making and experiencing through our work in regular community calls, blogposts, wiki pages and demo rounds. Mozillians participate and collaborate to keep the web open and free, but the open, participatory methods we use can be used for anything.

So let’s get down to brass tacks. HOW do you design for participation? What actions do WE have to take to invite people in? It’s not just facilitation, it’s about empowerment. So how do we empower people to step out of their shell and believe that their ideas matter?

Instead of me talking for another 60 minutes, how about we figure that out together. 

I have here a stack of paper and a bunch of post it notes. Here’s what we’re going to try.

I’m going to give you 20 minutes to brainstorm some ideas of activities you would use to get people participating in a meeting. Your first step is to define the meeting or event like “We’re at a meeting to determine the future of our fish-flavored toothpaste product.”

Then define the problem you need to solve “We’re not doing well in the market, we think we need a new design.”

How will you invite people to solve a problem? Or better said, how would you invite people to design a solution? What if there were 5 people, 15 people 50 people? 

Define the participatory activities that you’ll use to get those 50 people to solve your problem.

In 20 minutes, We’ll do something we call speedgeeking – you sell us your participatory ideas in 1 minute. Your group is going to have 1 minute to blow our minds with your plan. 

So, last instruction, you’re going to collaborate on this. Find five people, once you find your five people, send someone up here to get some paper and markers, here’s a countdown.

Afterwards, we’ll have a little time for Q &amp; A, ok? Is there any one here who hates everything about this idea and is willing to vocalize it? Oh good, that was terrifying for me.

Ok, here’s a timer, ready, set Go!

Group 1 - come on down….

Thanks everyone for indulging me, I hope that was fun for you, I hope you learned something together. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.

            <Text>Culture Shifts towards Open and the influence of Social Norms

As we move towards more people-powered, innovative and technology-supportive management structures, we need to think more strategically about ways to engender cultures of openness. This presentation will draw on the research literature around embedding cultures of openness, as well as the presenters experience in a variety of educational institutions and multi-national organisations such as Mozilla and Greenpeace. Laura will define culture as a shared space and "the prevailing beliefs, values, and customs of a group" (The Culture Group, 2013). She will unpick this, investigating and discussing what people do in that shared space. This will include: (i) identifying that prevailing mindsets and values influences a group's way of being, (ii) explaining how observing the ways people share both physical and digital spaces allows us to determine the practices that make up a culture, and (iii) showing how a cultural shift towards open starts with understanding these practices and gently implementing open techniques to improve efficiency, productivity, creativity and innovation. 

As open practices are "the antithesis of traditional organizational management structures" (Hilliger, 2015), success is achieved instead by a focus on the values and mission statement of the  organisation (Whitehurst, 2015). Laura believes teaching, learning and research to be at the forefront of implementing cultural shifts. Social and cultural perspectives stem from individual backgrounds, so it is crucial to include professional development and technical training around the definition of "open" for open source methodologies to proliferate. In complicated and fast-moving global networks, strategies must take into account existing infrastructures and subcultures. Organisations can institute teaching and learning initiatives that support the transition towards open by using these structures, engaging individually with subcultures, working with allies and modeling behaviors. 

This session will provide insight into the kinds of participatory programming and facilitation that has led to successful cultural change in various organisations. It will look at a certain set of behaviors that spur cultural shift at individual levels. Laura will talk about different levels of openness, both for individuals and organisations. Laura will examine the social and cultural norms that make open implementation more or less difficult, and explore leadership competencies whose practice leads to gaining merit in a meritocracy. 

In short, Laura will provide insight into the social and cultural norms that make the transition to an open organization difficult. She will explore the emotional and social side of open community building. She will offer strategies and mindsets to help people and organisations flourish by learning to modify their behaviors and practices based on the nuance of culture and subcultures.

Laura's work has centered in helping people learn open practices, developing leaders and modeling the open attitude. In a traditionally secretive organizations like Greenpeace, helping people transition requires empathy, understanding and patience. Even in fully open organizations like Mozilla, maintaining an open attitude can be tricky. Laura will provide insight into the social and cultural norms that make the transition to an open organization difficult. She will explore the emotional and social side of open community building, and the leadership traits management should develop. She will offer strategies and mindsets to help people and organisations flourish by learning to modify their behaviors and practices based on the nuance of culture and subcultures.</Text>

            <Title>finnish residency</Title>
            <Text>I've never been a conventional person. I've spent my life following my passions and trying to understand what it is that I'm supposed to be doing here on the planet. My background is long and complicated, so the construction of this question is a bit difficult for me. I need design constraints for this question.

My resume and the type of writing I do professionally is less the reason I'm applying for this residency. My professional makeup is still relevant in some form, but I'm looking to extend a creative side that isn't explicitly linked to the writing I do for work.

I've been working in the space between social justice and technology my entire career. For the last year or so I've felt myself struggling to believe. I feel like hope is hidden. The media, the masses, the state of the world – despite the facts that we're living in the most peaceful time, that people are happier now than they've ever been, that infant mortality rates are down, that we’re healthier, happier – despite these things, I feel like the work I do has become harder, more complicated and more dangerous. 

I’ve write for and work with numerous communities online and through my work with open source. The space I’ve worked in as allowed me to serve as a bridge between technology and many other kinds of communities. Open communities are the ones that ground me the most. I feel accountable to the greater open community (which includes smaller communities) because it’s helped me carve out my identity. My participation in open source helped me understand myself in a way I can’t fully explain in an online text area. I am open. I’m an advocate for open practices, an expert on participatory methodologies, an idealist who believes that “openness” is personal and professional development rolled into a supportive community of crazy innovators. It is lifelong learning, a curiosity and a joy embodied in a diverse and disperse group of people. The open community is welcoming and thus serves as a touchstone for all of the other communities I’m a part of. Among the Greenpeace community, the introduction of open practices is creating equity among staff and volunteers. In my local sports club, transparency and decentralization has helped my team advance into the national league. My neighborhood non-profit has adopted an open policy for the shared garden the community built. Helping other people understand open practices is also at the heart of the educational technology co-operative I’m a part of.

I want to meet the people who will make me feel like the work I do matters. Maybe I can inspire people I meet in some way. Meeting passionate people, sharing ideas and exploring the space between social change, technology and learning is an excellent use of my time. But I also want to write.

The piece of my identity that feels the strongest yet lacks the practice and attention that I’d like to give it, is that of the author. I write constantly, but I’ve not taken a serious look at the creative endeavor of writing the way that I feel I should. I have a variety of ideas and half started projects that are personal and profound, but those projects always take a backseat to the non-profit and community driven world I work in. 

I’m applying for this residency to give myself a space to work on something that is purely creative and to explore what it means to be a writer in a more traditional sense. I want to be around people who have more of a connection to this artistic world and learn from them.

I have a half finished novel that I would like to complete, but by November maybe I'll have done that (!?). I also have an idea and a bunch of notes for a non-fiction book that explores the psychology of grief in a narrative form. This one is ... serious. I think it is the type of book that I needed once but never found, and I believe taking myself completely out of my daily context to focus on that is the only way it will ever get started.

            <Text>You see today, today being the day that I started writing this talk for you, my colleague, someone I admire a great deal, called me a sociopath. He was just kidding, but I stopped to think about my perceived lack of empathy and ended up taking an Internet quiz that would tell me whether or not I’m a sociopath (here’s a hint, if you’re worried about being a sociopath, you aren’t a sociopath).

The quiz told me that I’m within the normal range for a typical human being. Then it let me know that I might still be clinically depressed, schizophrenic, borderline, obsessive-compulsive or have AIDS, but random quiz maker didn’t have tests for those.

As a non-Sociopath I am, actually, pretty anti-social in my personal life. But I am incredibly social in my professional life, social to the 

I wasn’t always an open source activist. I wasn’t not an open source activist, I just didn’t know anything about open source. I used to think that Open Source was only a way of writing software, and until I got to know Mozilla, I didn’t have any idea of what that really meant. I was building things on the web. I taught myself HTML and CSS and enough Javascript to get by, and I became kind of decent at ActionScripting and building interactive stories and designing and building websites for people. At the beginning of my career I was working freelance and teaching web technologies and software in San Francisco trying, like every other almost college graduate, to figure out what the hell I was going to do with my life. 
Somewhere in there, I cofounded a startup where we tried to supplement Art Education (or rather the lack of it in our education systems) with online video tutorials on creative subjects. Stuff like how to make mosaics or throw ceramic pots or how to build a website using Fireworks and Dreamweaver. I moved out of San Francisco to Germany and kept trying to make the business run. It failed epically BUT as a last ditch effort to save it, I went to the very first Mozilla Festival in Barcelona. 
And that’s where my whole world changed. The first Mozilla Festival, called “Learning, Freedom and the Web” was organized to try and figure out how people were using web technologies in new ways or how they wanted to. Mozilla had this theory that putting educators and technologists together could lead to something bigger. Let me back up a second.
You know Mozilla as the maker of Firefox, and now Firefox OS, but there are still a lot of people who don’t know that Mozilla is an open source project. Hopefully, this crowd knows that. Mozilla is a non-profit. There are no share holders. There are no stock fluctuations. Our mission is to help people understand what it means to have an open web, and we have a set of principles that we believe are critical for the continued health of the Internet. Mozilla promotes teaching the web, and we build the underlying technologies that make it possible to keep the learning relevant over a long time. 
So Mozilla threw this “Learning, Freedom and the Web” festival, and I applied to show my startup at the Science Fair so that I could understand why no big corporation had offered us millions of dollars for it. What I learned was not that the Startup was a bad idea or that the content sucked or anything that had to do with the startup at all (actually, people really liked it). But what I learned is that Mozilla is a community of people. Mozillians are people who know that the Web is built to be interoperable, knowable and that it belongs to us. All of us. 
What I found was a bunch of passionate people who believed that the Web could aid in making the world a better place. They were people who loved the Web I loved. Not a specific website or application, but the entire idea that the Web connects us and allows us to explore key problems together. What I found were a bunch of people who were working together to make the world a better place. I found people who pushed at things in my belief system. Things that had always felt a little wrong, but I could never pinpoint why. I was challenged, engaged - people seemed to care what I thought, even though I didn’t know them. WHY!?

I started contributing to Mozilla after that first experience. I was so fascinated by the distributed ownership and responsibility, so moved by the idea that connecting could make our world better, so excited that Mozilla was working to make sure the internet stays open, participatory, decentralized and public a 100 years from now, that I just got addicted. 

My participation in a vision of what teaching and learning around technology could be, my participation in the open governance structures I was introduced to at that first event, fundamentally changed who I am and what motivates me. Being asked to participate is what led me to asking others to participate.


I think the real life aspect of our training program is massively important because meeting people in real life strengthens our connections to them. Our minds shift when people become a physical identity, just like the physical cards at Mozfest caused a shift in people’s minds to help them feel agency, so too does a physical persona help solidify connections.

            <Title>Jim Whitehurst's speech from Agile Day - the power of open</Title>
            <Text>Jim Whitehurst’s Speech from Agile day

I often have the pleasure of traveling around the world and there is one thing I’ve noticed. One thing that has become starkly clear over the last couple of years, that everyone is starting to realize the real impact of performance of IT is about developing faster. If you look at the typical IT department, about 20-25% of an IT shop’s cost is hardware and software; the cost is not the underlying infrastructure it’s the cost of developing and managing the applications that sit on top of that. Things like Containers, agile and DevOps have the ability to triple the productivity of and IT department whilst infrastructure had an increase in the cost of the company.  

I want to focus on contextualizing what we are trying to achieve outside of IT. As we think about accelerating innovation and IT, it’s a specific use case of a much broader challenge. We are moving from an economy that was primarily based around industrial revolution, which is all about efficiency, to an much more commoditized driven society. 

Ask yourself the question, ‘how do we think about getting things done? Driving efficiency to create value or driving innovation to create value?’ It’s an incredibly hard problem broadly. A lot of it has to do with management and implementation.
The way we organize is called management. Many scholars believe the concept of management is a 21st century solution. Traditional management was developed under the context where people were relatively uneducated doing specific jobs in a static and latent information environment. It’s an engineering problem. How would you coordinate this behavior to solve this problem? Trying to get uneducated people to accomplish road tasks is how the traditional management structure came about.  Today, we’re dealing with relatively educated, certainly worldly people given you increasing levels of education and access information Internet etc.

Today, most road tasks have been automated. Basically in a world that the tasks that remain are judgment calls all the way up to creativity by people. It shouldn't be surprising that these engineering solutions are used to coordinate people’s behavior when the objective function is different, the type of people you're measuring and managing are different their education context during the ability to actually communicate different. If you know anything about engineering, you know that the answer to that problem probably looks different in comparison to the engineering problem to the industrial world. Most of us still live in that context of a traditional management structure. Even though we're moving from an IT contact with 75% about efficiency, and 25% innovation (I think 90% efficiency 10% innovation) roadwork innovations are taking center stage and that’s how we want to think about managing. You see this every day in an IT context, because it's not the same thing, it's not about how many of you are engineering the corporation it’s about how you take variants out. All those things that we did in IT in the early 90s to mid 90s to drive efficiency right all about efficiency what now this is not that you don't need an ERP system is just that is not where value is being created today it's about how do we innovate how do we add your functionality more quickly how do we more quickly respond to competitive environment will quickly change to recognize changes in marketplace respond to customers more quickly right now the value is not the dollars yet spent, The value is around how you innovate more quickly. 

It’s not all about tools and technology, which are key part of the problem, but I just want to emphasize upfront, you can say agile or DevOps or whatever, a faster pace of development is not just about the tools. Obviously the tools are an important piece but culture process mindset, I would argue, give even more important discussions, and recognize. The good news out of this is people have to recognize the problem before it happens, and TIOs recognize the problem before it happens. 

It really is something that we all need to recognize, and be champions of. The problem with computers is they do what you say, not what you mean. IT is very similar. IT is also on the front wave of something that is more broadly impacting the industry when we’re going from a world about efficiency to a world about innovation. So many of the principals about process mindset culture, will ultimately be the same processes that will impact company’s ability to do this. 

How did I get here?
I am the frog thrown into boiling water. What I mean by that is I think I fully recognize that there is a need for change in a different way because I got the gift of coming from running a very traditional company. I was COO of delta airlines, where everything was very military rigorous. So, when I was brought into Red Hat I thought this was total chaos, obviously I was there to clean things up considering there was no processing system in place before. Sometime I would bring things to the table and would get shut down and told that it was a bad idea. But I’m lucky, because before I had the chance to change Red Hat, Red Hat changed me. Being the frog that jumped into the boiling water, I’ve had invaluable experiences enough to write a book, called “The Open Organization”. It’s not about what I’ve done; it’s about what I’ve learned. To some extent Red Hat as an organization took these principles and made a company out of that and really aligns with the open source model, and open organization structure. 

Engaging and being participative are the fundamental principles of the next generation organizational model. We all need to think of our organizations as people who choose to be there, it’s participative. That mental mindset as a leader changes the concept of the “employee contract”. 

Let’s think about this. Let’s talk about contextualizing the framework and then I'll quickly talk to some of the components. Looking back at the biggest constraint around or problems with the traditional model of management is that it develops kind of in the late 1800s early 1900s, about the same time as economics. The reason I bring up a parallel is there a bunch of social sciences that were social studies before that and we decided to apply the scientific method to them. Economics is probably the classic example. So when we think about economics is the science and apply the scientific method that we had to make some assumptions to make the math work. Taking a class for microeconomics upward sloping supply curve, downward sloping demand curve and this assumes everybody's totally rational, perfect information, and markets are always in equilibrium. Anybody who lived between 2007 and 1987 we all know that markets are always in equilibrium and we absolutely no people are always rational. If we were all rational we would save exactly how much money we should save so we can retire exactly when we want to and we would always weigh exactly what we want to weigh, because what we eat would be rational. And now there's a whole department called behavioral economics. Behavioral economics is very much how do you recognize and measure the fact that people aren’t always rational and similar imperfections that some people might have. A fascinating book on this called Freakonomics dives into the fact that there is no generalized theory of behavior. 

There’s a lot we can do to recognize and use the fact that people are irrational in similar ways. This how we help people with things like insurance, public policy, spending and saving etc. The same thing is true in management. What we are noticing is that when you recognize people are emotional beings, with a purpose, and can be inspired, basically the theory of management changes pretty dramatically. This is not some new generalized theory of management, but it is a set of lessons learned from what Red Hat’s done. 

Some principles for running and effective business that are applicable to many other organizations include, what, why, and how. The what, a budget, and the why, the paycheck, determine traditional organizations. More effective organizations are run the other way around, starting with the why.  People want to be treated fairly and there’s study after study after study that if you don’t treat people fairly, they won’t perform well. If you pay people fairly, beyond that most people are much more interested in a broader meaning for what they're doing and how they're having an impact on society and the world around them. They are getting an even larger bonus and really providing the context of what and how they’re making a difference. 

Thinking about what is the purpose of the organization. The ‘how’ in a traditional organization can be viewed as that people do what they are supposed to do. We often know people don't do exactly what they're supposed to do nor to people necessarily always have productive dialogue and that's. Second on that is a critical thing that we all need to recognize in order to innovate. You need a productive constructive dialogue to get to the right answers and get there effectively.  Leaders can be much more of a catalyst when they are 

At Red Hat we are so passionate that some of our employees have the logo tattooed on them. It’s crazy but we really do believe deeply in the mission of the company, which is around open-source and how the training of software is developed and consumed. For each of you, your companies have a mission. There is a purpose. I think that a company that in business if its not creating value at some level for their customers. Your job is to make sure your employee activities are connected back to that mission.  An elite change in performance just making sure that people understand that what they are doing and how accelerating products or services fits into that broader mission. It makes a huge difference.

Engagement is something I’m amazed of how few organizations take this into consideration. It’s imperative for how you're going to accelerate innovation in your organization. What I mean by engagement is making sure that the people in your organization understand the strategy of the company and very specifically, how your organization fits into it. Why are you delivering faster, what does that mean and how does it fit into the overall hold of the company. 

Quick story from when I was at Delta and I had the experience of dealing with bankruptcy restructuring, which was a very very difficult time. One of the things that happened during the bankruptcy was we went out and spent a lot of time talking about the details of the turnaround to our front-line employees and one of the things we said was on-time performance is critical. We have to run quality operation during this bankruptcy time, to assure customers that were not going away. We told our employees that is the single one thing that you can do to help Delta's turnaround. Delta went from dead last to number one for on-time performance among the major carriers and healthy consistently for the next couple years. All we did was tell everyone it was important, and deeply talk about the strategy of the company and how to align with the broader impact. Making sure people deeply understand why what they're doing is important especially, about agile and data, and about the importance of accelerating the pace of innovation and how incredibly important it can be to corporate strategy and the overall success of the company is your job to make that link. It's that's a multilevel link that most people are not going to make if you don't really spend time and think about the stories you’re going to tell. That is the leaders that are driving that accelerated innovation and connecting to the overall success of the company.

Next is the ‘how’, that basically people are currently rational beings how people work together. We know that the single biggest kind of areas where companies fall apart is around culture and people not working productively together. We all know from managing that is absolutely critical is the company. My third week at Red Hat I had a meeting about virtualization. It was about why we chose and the dynamics around it. At some point an engineer the meeting says what we're doing is the wrong approach. Things go a little heated as always and people were yelling, yet everybody walked out feeling good about the meeting. I was sitting here thinking, you know at Delta if someone yelled in front of their boss and their bosses boss and their bosses boss’s boss, it would have been completely wrong and that person would've been fired before the meeting was over. Being able to have those types of productive conversations is critical to success in any type of conversation. Managing and having the right level of dialogue is critical to success especially think about something like where you're going have to work cross functionally having productive conflict to get the right answers, is actually critical. 

If there's more honesty at the water cooler than there is in the conference rooms, then you have a problem. This true especially when thinking about cross functional teams to make sure the right dialogue is coming out and you’re having the right constructive conflict to get the right answers. Yeah, there's a concept that we all use called brainstorming. Brainstorming was developed in the 1950s it an ad agency in New York to encourage people give ideas and a lot of positive feedback years starting in 1960s. There's a ton of academic evidence all the way to today said brainstorming is a terrible way to get the best ideas. The best way to get ideas is to encourage people to give ideas but be honest when there is a bad idea, but when we think about combining with this or try again having that kind of constructive dialogue. This strategy is having much much better. I know it's messy because it's people and it's often personally hard to make sure that you're having the right sets of dialogs. Ultimately, I would argue, it’s much more important to have the dialogue than the tools as you start thinking about how was your get it innovate faster develop more quickly. 

I began to wonder, what is the role leader in these organizations? So, as leader at Red Hat I saw this kind of self-organizing group of very bright people. 
I started to ask myself these questions and answer came to me based on something we did in my first year at Red Hat. We talked about the fact that Red Hat a vision around changing the way software developed and consumed in open-source and democratizing information content etc. Which is very high-level breath of a goal but we didn't have a mission statement at all. So what are we doing a what is our mission will let's get in Red Hat terms anybody want to be involved together to talk about that. So we did a lot of work around that we came up with the first draft kind of an alpha draft which was Red Hat mission is to be the leader in communities of customers triggers, and partners will better technology the open source way. So the first part to be the catalyst for the first was to be the leader in the back and said that's wrong, we don't have a leadership role in these communities.  So, we rewrote a beta draft a few weeks later, and we got a bunch people together. It was to be an active participant in communities. The same as the original feedback, that it’s not right either because that implies that were passively. Where there by the fact that we contribute we can try direction of organizations are or of communities that were involved and been sometimes leaders have to make quick decisions have to make hard decisions. They'll have time to fully synthesize this but on our best days when we I truly do my job I try to create the context in which the best decisions a bird so areas like how do we get more customer focused as we grow and our portfolio expands. I didn't hire some consultant or do some top down here is what we need to do, I just do it out of the company saying we need to think about it, it's important when you think about it, and people rose up. Our customer service organization freed up some of our people’s time to do outbound calling to customers that don't have problems, by the way it is the most bizarre conversation, to call up your customer who never called or had a complaint. We also added to our plug-ins, as a person freed up some time added to our product is the proactive diagnostics. So, basically if you try the Red Hat enterprise Linux it'll actually compare your existing infrastructure to our tens of thousands of new cases, and say which areas that might get disabled or that may not be stable over time. Many things that happen around the company not because I ordered it, not because I planned it, not because I read a product around it, because I said it was important and that's the essence of really thinking about how you put structures in place with things that you want to happen. 

Finishing up again on the implications for innovation, this I would actually argue is one of the single biggest challenges we're going to have as organizations. I think it will ultimately impact society and that's very simply the largest wealth creation for everyone that we've ever seen happen. After 1871 we figured out mass manufacturing and we figured out how to be more efficient making stuff for people and it pulled the majority of the world out of subsistence to middle-class. This created an enormous wealth of institution and other types of advancement. We figured out how to produce things more efficiently. We are now entering a world where we've developed world in overtime it is not about more stuff, it's about how we make that's used that stuff more efficiently. We can't know only multiple cars or this or that but how we actually use things more efficiently, how we innovate is going to be the next driver in value for creation for our organization often on a collective basis for society. It's going to be about how we innovate and figure out how our organizations can move more quickly to solve massive problems that we have. That comes down to tools, certainly in IT about tools but its processes mindset. Focusing on the next-generation way of how we all work together to solve big big big problems are happening in the world. We’re still in the relatively I would say early innings of this. I think I will talk to a piece of the other people that you are all working on in your own organizations on how to explore a innovation will be synthesized and people will figure out how to do that even better as we all continue to work forward, but is not just about delivering a more specific feature on your website. This ultimately is going to come down to how we innovate more quickly to solve a lot of problems and a lot of experimentation is going to need to continue to happen. It is a massive challenge but a massive opportunity and the faster we figure these things out, the better off you are children will be. Back to technology, this really does come down to how it's not about any one organization, it is not about proscribing it's about how coalitions and groups of us can work together to solve these problems and is kind of fundamentally advancing. Red Hat does what we believe in through our open organization mission. </Text>

            <Text>Why do you want to attend Web of Change?* 
A colleague at Greenpeace sent me an email that I would love to be at Web of Change. He said his participation in your community has been an incredible experience. So I went to your website because that's what people do when someone they respect says, "You would like this". It was the video that most excited me at the idea of coming to Web of Change. In particular, Christine Cordero talking about how reinvigorating Web of Change was for her. I've been working in the space between social justice and technology my entire career. For the last year or so I've felt myself struggling to believe. I feel like hope is hidden. The media, the masses, the state of the world – despite the facts that we're living in the most peaceful time, that people are happier now than they've ever been, that infant mortality rates are down, that we’re healthier, happier – despite these things, I feel like the work we do has become harder, more complicated and more dangerous. I want to attend the Web of Change to meet the people who will make me feel the way that Christine felt at the end of the event. Maybe I can inspire people I meet in some way. Meeting passionate people, sharing ideas and exploring the space between social change, technology and learning sounds like an excellent use of my time.
Where do you find/create community, and how do those communities ground you and/or hold you accountable? This can include activist communities, sports clubs, neighborhood groups etc?*

I’ve found numerous communities online and through my work with open source. The space I’ve worked in as allowed me to serve as a bridge between technology and many other kinds of communities. Open communities are the ones that ground me the most. I feel accountable to the greater open community (which includes smaller communities) because it’s helped me carve out my identity. My participation in open source helped me understand myself in a way I can’t fully explain in an online text area. I am open. I’m an advocate for open practices, an expert on participatory methodologies, an idealist who believes that “openness” is personal and professional development rolled into a supportive community of crazy innovators. It is lifelong learning, a curiosity and a joy embodied in a diverse and disperse group of people. The open community is welcoming and thus serves as a touchstone for all of the other communities I’m a part of. Among the Greenpeace community, the introduction of open practices is creating equity among staff and volunteers. In my local sports club, transparency and decentralization has helped my team advance into the national league. My neighborhood non-profit has adopted an open policy for the shared garden the community built. Helping other people understand open practices is also at the heart of the educational technology co-operative I’m a part of.

Tell us something unique about yourself.* 
Where should I begin? Isn’t it an inherent trait of creative people that they feel like they are unique in a thousand different ways? Isn’t it part of the human condition to need to be unique? Shall I pick something completely randomly? Ok – the sports league I mentioned in the last question – I play roller derby in the German National League (Bundesliga). If you’ve never heard of Roller Derby, it’s commonly referred to as “rugby on roller skates”.  Playing in the German National League sounds impressive and roller derby IS the fastest growing sport in Europe. BUT it doesn’t feel like a big deal. It’s practice a few times a week and 5 official bouts (games) a year, plus scrimmages for fun. For me it’s more a study in group dynamics.

What is something that you’d like to share with the community? A talent or skill? Testimony from a campaign? Connections to a community? A workshop? Other?* 
The stuff I love always has a place if you’d like me to run a skills workshop. Really, I’m happy to help in any capacity you see fit. I often run sessions on designing for participation, open practices, distributed leadership, wholehearted activism, tricks, tools for establishing openness. In short - I’ll be pleased to be an active participant, share what I know and soak up the knowledge other people are willing to share.

Web of Change is, in our best moments, a community that seeks to fully see and value every participant in the ways that they want and need to show up in the WOC space. How would you want the WOC community to 'see' you in this space (including but not limited to personal identity, family background, cultural identity, political identity, etc.)?* 
This question stumps me. I want to be an open book, but my cultural and social conditioning makes this a challenge. I swing extrovert in social situations. I may come off as excited, talkative. I guess I’d like people to “see” that no matter how open I may appear, without knowing my past, my experiences, the things that have coalesced to create the “me in this exact moment” it’s impossible to fully understand someone. I guess I want people to see me for who I am, a complex, multi-layered individual. I try to do this for other people as well. Let’s see each other with empathy.

What is the best campaign you participated in this year and why? Or what is the best campaign you’ve seen in the last year and why?* 
Another difficult question! There are lots of campaigns that are inspiring and a bunch of different ways to define “the best”. I’ll just choose one that stuck. This year Mozilla released a campaign designed to help people understand why encryption is important. They aimed to give people basic skills to protect themselves online. I didn’t have anything to do with it, but the way my former colleagues built teaching and learning materials around a massively important, but seemingly complicated theme was inspiring. They simplified encryption for “any one”, had pretty graphics, used humor. I also think this is an important theme for every one, especially those working in activism. 

Is there anything else you’d like to share about yourself?* 
Not at the moment, but if I’m invited, I’ll look forward to creating those deep relationships past participants talked about in your testimonials.

How did you hear about Web of Change? If it was through a friend — which friend?* 

Scholarships are available as we want successful applicants to be able to attend, regardless of their ability to pay. Do you require financial support to attend Web of Change?

Full participation and active presence at Web of Change is critical for deep relationships and trust to emerge. Can you commit to attending all days of the conference?

Modeling Behaviors
Opening the door for people

http://www.laurahilliger.com/leadership/friendly-tips-for-keeping-your-contributors/

"Designing for Participation" is a way to provide  people with insights to your project. Documenting how you intend to make decisions, which communication channels you’ll use and how people can get in touch with you are the first steps in designing for participation. Working openly, being transparent, and using technologies that support collaboration, invite participation. These things provide context so that interested people can get up to speed and start participating in your project.

But there's more. There are things that happen behind the scenes of any open project that help contributors gain trust, take ownership and begin to help you distribute leadership to the edges of a community.

This session will look at behaviors that spur cultural shifts. Drawing on her experience bringing open practices to Greenpeace International, Laura will examine the social and cultural norms that make open implementation more or less difficult.

Participatory Practices to Build Trust

Hi, my name is Laura Hilliger. I am a founding member of the We Are Open Cooperative and I work with Greenpeace International. Both my coop and my gig at Greenpeace is about spreading the beliefs, processes and culture of open. I also spent over five years working at Mozilla where I helped spread web literacy – the social and technical skills and competencies that make working openly possible.

And while I truly believe in the core of open practices – decentralizing power, 100% transparency, allowing for remixabilty – I also believe that this way of working and being is highly nuanced and utterly dependent on the collective consciousness, rather than individual understandings of “open”.

So today, I’m going to talk a little about the nuances I’ve seen in bringing open practices to closed or more traditional communities, and then I’m going to invite you to openly reflect or ask questions. 

SLIDE

I am constantly learning about participation. I don’t mean that I’m studying participation or collaboration as an academic, I’m not actually collecting data on how or why people start on a pathway towards an open and participatory viewpoint, I’m saying that as a human being, I am learning what it means to participate. In life. In work. In relationships. In connection. In being human.

I actively observe the participation of others and my own internal dialog. My peers, my colleagues, my audience – how their behaviors and expressions make me feel. I use this as a base to understand how my behaviors affect other people and how I can better connect. 

What we say and do in a social space changes the fabric of that social space. They way we interact changes the way others interact with us. Knowing ourselves helps us develop not only relationships, but the skills and competencies we need to improve our lives. 

Our physical and mental well being is inextricably linked to our ability to connect with people.

If you yell at people they are likely to yell back. If you are calm, people around you will be calmer. If you laugh or smile, endorphins are released in your brain as well as in other people’s brains. How we treat each other matters.

SLIDE

 I explain "participatory" as the difference between a lecture and a conversation. It's the difference between passive and active. Centering on people’s interests and facilitating connections to help people produce something is valuable to their personal and professional development. Humans live for connection, we physically need it.

So people who believe in open strive to design projects to be participatory and collaborative by creating structures where roles are shifted.

There are many simple techniques that help people have agency. My top 3 are super simple, yet somehow lacking in our day to day work. 

Community Calls. Here’s a guide, this is long term trust building.
Individual outreach. It’s so easy to say please and thank you. 
Listening. Amazing what you hear if you learn to listen well.

SLIDE

Emotion is influenced by surroundings and norms, so what keeps us from truly participating 100% of the time is fear and the social and cultural norms we’ve been taught are rules in civil discourse and social behavior. We’ve been taught that that the speaker is notable, that the CEO has vision, that the teacher is the expert, that the police maintain control, that respect means being quiet and letting others have the floor. We’ve been taught that gendered bathrooms is “right”.

But all of that is a collective perception that has roots.

With the invention of the web, we’re much quicker to learn histories and contexts, relationships and influences that we didn’t know about before. Our ability to connect, allows us to talk about social norms and push back at common public perceptions. 

This is beginning to bleed into the real world in fascinating ways. We’ve been taught a certain degree of distrust, but much of the open community is adopting views around the way we interact with each other. There are communities who are putting trust at the center of how they operate.

Views like “Everyone’s voice matters” or “There are no stupid questions”. Simple, humanistic points of view that are directly related to how we as human beings participate in the world and govern our lives.

In business, this is changing entire power structures and dynamics.

SLIDE

I think we all want to be honest and open. I think we all need accolades and encouragement, and I think that we all feel like we have to prove to others that we are capable. But we convince ourselves that we’ll be damaged if we live up to those values. We are afraid that someone else will receive accolades that were supposed to be ours. We become discouraged and despondent because we allow ourselves to fester with envy and fear. 

We humans are afraid to just be ourselves.

Through my work with We Are Open and Greenpeace, I aim to encourage not only the Open Source community, but the Activist community to try out loud. Come up with a new way to start a conversation, or a new way to implement design constraints, or a new way to get people to share ideas, and then try it. Who cares if you fail? Why not learn something new today.

The way you participate in the world says something about your values. The way your organizations run meetings and events say something about how they view your and your peers contributions. If you’re working at an organization that is open or trying to be open, you and your colleagues should feel comfortable expressing your opinion, even when your opinion is quite obviously not widely shared. Being bold, having a voice, and helping other people have a voice creates communities of trust.

SLIDE

Putting everyone on the same level and giving everyone agency and promoting open collaboration is a terrifying prospect, especially in business. It’s a pretty unnatural feeling. And it’s a pretty impossible feeling to feel, all the time, that we are worthy of having voice. 

We are groomed to understand hierarchies, authorities and seniorities. From the moment we, as toddlers, start testing the resolve of our parents, we start to learn that the world doesn’t revolve around our individual selves and we begin to perceive that someone else in any given situation has more power than we do. 

We are told what we’re not capable, and for whatever reason, we believe what we’re told. Sometimes, we assume that someone else has more information, and sometimes they do, but sometimes the greater good is something we can influence, and we choose not to because, again, we’re afraid.

Let’s be very clear that openness, collaboration and respect for ourselves does not mean filterless, controlling and arrogant. It’s about conditioning our emotional intelligence. 

SLIDE

 If we study communities, we can identify the prevailing mindsets and values that influence a group's way of being. By observing the ways people share both physical and digital spaces we can determine the practices that make up a culture, and understanding these practices and gently implementing open techniques and attitudes will improve efficiency, productivity, creativity and innovation. That is a culture shift towards open.

SLIDE

We can and should give people the agency to take control. We should encourage people to share their perspectives so that we can instigate change, be better people. We can encourage these things on an individual or on a large scale, it's all about attitude. It’s so easy to give agency – you simply say “What do you think” or send a two sentence email that offers a human connection. Hey Thanks for showing up. It’s so simple, but it means something. 

Humans are built for connection. The same neural circuits process physical pain AND social pain. That means that feeling isolated or disconnected can be just as painful as getting hit by a bus.

Inviting people to participate with you, personally, with the work generally, helps lay the ground work for a participatory project.

SLIDE

We need to design spaces, digitally and physically, that honor participants. These spaces must respect their intellect, their skills and their time. If we place making, feedback and learning at the center, we can focus on the desires and goals of the very people we seek to honor. 

We ask ourselves every step of the way, is this valuable for people? Is it fun? How is their contribution beneficial to them? This is how we can start to breed leadership competencies. Create a situation where people feel comfortable talking control.

Learning how participatory design can empower community is something I started to learn about in the open source community. Open source has a bunch of passionate people who believe that the Web could aid in making the world a better place. They were people who loved the Web I loved. Not a specific website or application, but the entire idea that the Web connects us and allows us to explore key problems together. What I found was a community. I found people who pushed at things in my belief system. Things that had always felt a little wrong, but I could never pinpoint why. I was challenged, engaged - people seemed to care what I thought, even though I didn’t know them.

SLIDE

I started contributing to open source. I was so fascinated by the distributed ownership and responsibility, so moved by the idea that connecting could make our world better, so excited that Mozilla, which is where I became involved in open, was working to make sure the internet stays open, participatory, decentralized and public a 100 years from now, that I just got addicted. I found collaborators. 

At Mozilla, it was easy to give people agency.  If you are an ecosystem that makes open collaboration the norm instead of the fun thing you get to do every once in a while, you reap the rewards of what that collaboration brings. There are plenty of examples where open collaboration is the norm in Open Source.

SLIDE

But what about outside of FOSS? Providing agency and leading the way towards more open modes of working and being is at the heart of all the things I work on at Greenpeace.

It is the reason I urge colleagues to publish  links to every document, image, bug and product. It’s also the reason I serve as a model by stating my case, regardless of perceived power dynamics.

I organize my own work around the idea that other people can participate. I believe that together we are smarter. Participation is key for any organization looking to change the world, so getting people to trust in best intentions again is part of making the world a better place.

Shifting the behaviors and mindsets of “everyone”, which, by the way is every non-profits target audience, means that we need the input and understanding of “everyone”. We have to stop pretending like we can save the planet without the “masses”. 

I’ve learned that you have to help people understand why their participation is necessary and create systems that make participation easy. You have to help people understand what you’re working on, and you have to respect peoples contributions. Most importantly, you have to model the behaviors you want to see in the world.
SLIDE

The We Are Open Coop is grounded in the idea that if we model the behaviors we want to see,  we will influence the behaviors of others. We established ourselves as a coop because we want to create an equitable business in which all the members benefit. Membership is open, we spread open values, we have open communication channels. All of this is an effort to create equitable, humanistic work environments. 

Anyone here have a micromanaging boss? Yeah, not necessary right? 

Your behaviors reflect your values. This is true for our personal lives and our professional lives, wherein our behaviors are often clouded by our own perceptions of self, our cultural and social backgrounds, our assumptions of what the world wants from us. 

SLIDE

I think designing and using participatory methods is mostly about opening the door for people. Help people see what it means to have agency. We're successful if we take initiative. It doesn't matter if we fail, it's about believing that we have agency.

“Second, I continue to think about the modular pieces that are so important in the development of #teachtheweb materials. The elements that I notice can be powerful to pull together in my own work with adult educators include:
	•	Examples of remixes by youth that can be used as mentor texts — these should come in the range of formats, done by a range of ages, and include a range of content.
	•	Fun, playful starter makes across all the tools that engage a range of interests and levels of experience with webmaking.
	•	Remixable activities (not necessarily “kits” but more like activities and sets as curations) that educators have developed that pull these together around some shared activities and/or content goals.
And then third, I love the remixable nature of all this work and the potential for remixable curriculum as a result — or at least remixable curricular elements. Chad talks about this in his own post-Mozfest reflection …
I’m even more interested in Thimble as a storehouse for web native curriculum – especially for product- and tool-making around participatory learning and inquiry.
… and I love the way that he takes this on and really does make his work available to others here too.
What I keep wondering then, is how to pull these things together … not necessarily as teaching kits which is kind of hard-coded manual process (as lovely and remixable as they might be), but as related elements that I might use together at any one time. A little mini-curation or gallery of items that I could remix and reuse among each other in different ways. Hmmmm. …
Finally, as I wrap up this post I am also reading what my colleagues wrote in their reflections (Peter Kittle here/Chad here) and I am struck by all the moments where we lifted our heads and connected with those around us and what it is that we found. #teachtheweb is certainly about creating curriculum and modularized content, I believe, and I also think there is a role of #researchtheweb and #learntheweb that those teaching the web need to engage with constantly and at events like these.”

Die Leute die partizipieren in Open Source Gemeinschaften haben eine Kultur. Es ist eine gewissene Internet Kultur – ein Kultur die versteht das wir die Macht haben, das Internet frei zu gestalten, und das dieser Macht wird in realen Welt transportiert. 

Wikipedia SLIDE
Ihr habt sicherlich alle über Arab Spring gehört oder die Tag die Internet ist schwarz gegangen? Das war keine Zauberei (obwohl das Web ist totaler Wahnsinn), das war aber Aktionen die unser Welt verbessert hat.

Das ist was unser Studenten lernen müssen – die müssen die Kultur und Funktionen des Webs lernen, weil gebildet zu sein heißt dass man kritisch über Schlüsselprobleme nachdenkt (Klafki). Das Web beinhaltet die Information der Welt und das Wissen der Menschheit. Es stellt uns die Infrastruktur bereit, über solche Probleme nachzudenken und sie zu lösen. 

SLIDE
Wenn ihr wollen Lernen unterstützen, gibt es keiner einziger Werkzeug. Lernen ist chaotisch, alle lernen anders, und Lernmanagement System sind größten teils totalen schrott.

Ihr sollen dieser Kultur des Internets nicht nur durch mich kennenlernen, aber tiefer eingehen – wenn ihr das Web versteht, kann ihr eine persönliches Bildungsraum für jeder Lerner erschaffen.

“Open” heißt 3 Dinger, die ihr in euer Praxis einarbeiten können.
Decentraliziert: Schau mal um – du hast Freunde, Kollegien, Peers, im echt. Du hast die auch im digitalen Bereich - auch wenn du die noch nicht kennst. Niemand besitzt Wissens – da gibt es keiner der alles weißt. Alle besitzen Wissens, und wenn Wissens dezentralisiert ist, sollte auch andere Sachen, wie Inhalt, Lehrmateriellen, u.s.w

Innovation &amp; Hackability: Das hat mit freies Wissens zu tun. Wenn jemand oder je Corporation versucht Ideen zu besitzen, können wir, die Menschen des Welts, schlecht neuer Ideen erfinden. Ideen sind doch an anderen Ideen gebaut.

Transparenz: Wenn du sehen kannst wie etwas gemacht ist, kannst du es, oder etwas ähnlich, nachbauen. Stell dir vor du hast gerade das bestes Kuchen der Welt gegessen. Du willst es nach machen, aber du hast keine Ahnung was da drin war. Transparenz heißt der Koch gibt dir der Rezept. Das heißt nicht das du die selbe Kuchen machen kannst, oder das deins besser wird. Das heißt nicht das der Koch verliert sein Restaurant weil irgend eine Kunde ein einzige Rezept gekriegt hat. Es heißt einfach dass du eine leckere Kuchen backen versuchen kannst.

Alles was wir machen bei Mozilla ist offen. Wir haben regelmassiger Community Calls, Entscheidungen sind in Gruppen ertroffen, du kannst jeder Frage stellen…unser Lehrmateriellen, von die Gemeinschaft gemacht, Projekten Ideen, Medien als Lernen – alles ist mit und für das Web gebaut, und kann auch auseinander gesetzt werden.

Wir versuchen zwischen Technologien und Pädagogin eine Lücken zu schliessen. Wir haben verschiedene Kompetenzen – wenn wir zusammen arbeiten, wird die Pedagogie und die Technologie besser.

Ich habe dieser Dia eingebaut weil da war dieser Frau in einer meine Workshops – ganz negativ, eine totaler Dummheit. Um ihr rühig zu machen, habe ich eine Lüge gespunn – eine sehr spezifische Lüge. Später habe ich gelernt das die Frau…naja war “wichtig”. Und später wollte sie die Wahrheitsbeweis um ein andere “wichtiger” Mensch zu zeigen. Ich hab “Ach Sheet” gedacht. Aber dann habe ich gesucht, und gefunden wonach ich gesucht habe. Eine Projekt in Süd Italian, die Augmentierte Realität über Rome legen werden um Gesichte zu lehren. Da ist mehr in das Web als ihr überhaupt vorstellen kann….

SLIDE Webmaker
Also, ich lehre das Web und seiner Kultur, und ich wollte euch ganz viele Werkzeuge zeigen – aber ich habe nicht genügen Zeit schätze ich. Deswegen will ich euch das Web einfach demystifizieren. </Text>
