<br/>
I often have the pleasure of traveling around the world and there is one thing I’ve noticed. One thing that has become starkly clear over the last couple of years, that everyone is starting to realize the real impact of performance of IT is about developing faster. If you look at the typical IT department, about 20-25% of an IT shop’s cost is hardware and software; the cost is not the underlying infrastructure it’s the cost of developing and managing the a...</p>

Laura's work has centered in helping people learn open practices, developing leaders and modeling the open attitude. In a traditionally secretive organizations like Greenpeace, helping people transition requires empathy, understanding and patience. Even in fully open organizations like Mozilla, maintaining an open attitude can be tricky.<br/>

Abstract: If you want to have a high functioning team, you have to understand and interact with a variety of personality types. Managing group and team dynamics is an essential part of every job.

A colleague at Greenpeace sent me an email that I would love to be at Web of Change. He said his participation in your community has been an incredible experience. So I went to your website because that's what people do when someone they respect says, "You would like this". It was the video that most excited me at the idea of coming to Web of Change. In particular, Christine Cordero talking about how reinvigorating Web of Change was for her. I've been w...</p>

He was just kidding, but I stopped to think about my perceived lack of empathy and ended up taking an Internet quiz that would tell me whether or not I’m a sociopath (here’s a hint, if you’re worried about being a sociopath, you aren’t a sociopath).<br/>
